Are there any IDEs out there for Java development that have built-in support (or available plugins/extensions) for visual debugging of multithreaded programs in the same vein as Visual Studio allows you to visualise parallel stacks of multiple concurrent threads? I'm aware this has probably been asked many times before, but perhaps new tools have cropped up since previous discussions.
For ref, here's an example of what I'm talking about in VS, where the stacks for more than one thread are visualised:

"	"
Regarding the question at hand, IntelliJ allows you to visually see all the threads that currently exist/alive at runtime, from the tab called Threads, inside the debug session window (where you can view the individual stacks that correspond to each): Thread groups

Please note that I am a complete beginner and installed python simply by going to the website and clicking ""install"". It used to work fine.
Now suddenly I have this frustrating situation where I can run just about anything in the idle.exe found in the scripts section of arcgispro, but cannot run the same .py file in an IDE. As a beginner this is obviously a headache as I would like auto code formatting, suggestions, etc. Literally any IDE would be fine (spyder, pycharm). The problem is that every single time there is some kind of error with the package imports. e.g. from pycharm:
import shapefile ModuleNotFoundError: No module named 'shapefile'
It's not just shapefile... this is happened at random times with numpy and also matplotlib.
When I look at ""Installed Apps"" on windows, it just says Python 3.10.0 and Python Launcher.
No, there is no file that I created called ""shapefile.py""
A lot of solutions suggest things with pip... I have absolutely no idea what pip is...is it installed program? where do I find that?
EDIT: I just found out that the system paths of the two are different so this explains why one works but the other doesn't... but how can I make it so that the IDE would work?
"	"
Ok, simple answer:
In Pycharm, go to the bottomand click on Python Console. Then type pip install pyshp. Voila! Assuming it works for other packages as well. Still do not know where to make pycharm work with the other environment...

I'm having a really weird problem with my AS when creating a new Java Class; I've already tried other solutions in stack and android developers page, but nothing seems to work (reinstalling, class template, vm options and invalidate cache).
Error image
Does anyone figure out what is the problem?
Thanks

As i commented before, the problem was solved by rewriting the Java Class template in the project and global instance of it.
I don't really know why it didn't work before, but if someone is in that position just try again with this method.

I'm looking for opinions on the best development language to use to maintain one set of high-level application code for apps that can execute on Android and Raspberry Pi.
"	"
As of now Android only supports Java and Kotlin. Java is also supported on on Raspberry Pi. I have seen some people talk about using Kotlin on Rasberry but I think community support will be very limited if you go with Kotlin.
Also are you sharing code between the 2 platforms?? If you are sharing code then Java seems a safer bet as of now than Kotlin but if both code bases are not sharing anything and you you can use Kotlin for Android and any other supported language like Python Java JS or C for Rasberry Pi
............................................................
Thank you for taking the time to offer your thoughts.
I've decided to use Dart, along with the Webstorm IDE.Dart is an OOP language, multiplatform (potentially platform independent), and can compile to bytecode, Javascript or host object code.It sounds pretty exciting... we'll see after I have completed a couple of projects ;-)
https://dart.dev/overview
............................................................
As of now Android just sustains Java as well as Kotlin. Java is likewise sustained on Raspberry Pi I have seen some individuals speak about using Kotlin on Rasberry yet I assume area support will be extremely minimal if you choose Kotlin.
Likewise are you sharing code in between the 2 systems?? If you are sharing code after that Java seems a safer wager already than Kotlin however if both code bases are not sharing anything as well as you can utilize Kotlin for Android and any other supported language like Python Java JS or C for Rasberry Pi.

Windows 10, installed Python 3.10, then Spyder 5 from Windows Installer. Changed python interpreter (preferences) to the previously installed Python 10. Basically it works fine. However if I want to see in the Variable Explorer more complex objects like pandas dataframes, it gives back:
Spyder was unable to retrieve the value of this variable from the console. The error message was: ''
There is also no error message in the console
Without any error messages it's hard to trace back. Interesting enough, that pandas series are shown, data frames not. Any incompatibilites known between Spyder 5 and Python 3.10?
Any idea highly appreciated...
"	"
Downgrading pandas worked for me. I had version 1.4.2 of pandas and the Spyder installer I used (5.15) had come with pandas version 1.3.3. I think that version of spyder isn't compatible with the newer pandas version so I downgraded the pandas package that's used in the python interpreter (not the one that comes with the installer)to 1.3.3
You could also try different versions of the Spyder installer. A couple of the versions was giving me different problems and I found version 5.15 to be the sweet spot for my setup.

Problem Description
I need to configure the proxy manually in my emulator through Android Studio. From the official Android documentation, it is suggested that this change can be made in the ""settings"" tab of the emulator's extended controls. The problem is that it seems to me that this documentation is outdated, as this setting is no longer displayed in the ""settings"" tab of the Android Studio emulators' extended controls.

You can open old emulator version by unchecking setting here
If you struggle to close your old emulator, try killing qemu... process
............................................................
You can go to setup proxy in Android Studio itself.

Configure Proxy in the Preferences window


Go to Preferences window (Mac: cmd+, shortcut).
Click Appearance & Behavior on the left panel
Click System Settings on the left panel
Click HTTTP Proxy on the left panel
Setup your preferred proxy settings
Confirm by clicking OK


You need to restart emulator to apply your changes

The downside of the solution is that the proxy is also applied to Android Studio itself. So traffic from Android Studio goes through the proxy.
............................................................
After a while trying to find solutions to this problem, I saw that an emulator running outside android studio provides these options. To run a standalone Android Studio emulator see the official documentation or simply enter the command:
emulator -avd <avd_name>

In my case I'm using an avd named PIXEL 4 API 30, so the command will be emulator -avd PIXEL_4_API_30. If you are on Windows you may have problems running this command so I suggest you see this.
Edit
The solution proposed by @Inliner also solves this problem.

I'm looking for an HTML IDE (preferably free) or extension for Visual Studio Code that:
a)has a live preview feature
and
b) clicking or right-clicking an element in the live preview highlights the corresponding code.
This seems to be a bit elusive, which doesn't make a lot of sense to me considering how useful this is.
I'm currently using Visual Studio Code with the Live Preview extension, but it doesn't allow doing anything with the preview.
"	"
1, Adobe Dreamweaver, just use Split Mode.
You code yourself, just use the Editor part as a Live Preview so you won't mess-up with redundant and ugly codes.
You click on the code, and the live preview corresponding element will be highlighted, you click on the live preview, the text cursor will jump to the code.
2, Brackets
It just works exactly like what you want, but unfortunately, it is discontinued by Adobe.
3, Five servers (VSC Extension)
https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=yandeu.five-server
It is only one-way-highlight. You can't jump to code by clicking on Live Preview.
I haven't found any VSC extension working the way you want.

You are missing {} braces around your main() function's body, it needs to look more like this instead:
#include <cs50.h>
#include <stdio.h>

int main(void)
{ // <-- add this
while (true)
{
printf(""goddamnit\n"")
}
} // <-- add this

Block statements like if, for, while, etc can omit {} when their body is a single statement.Functions cannot do that.

I often like to work with multiple monitors when coding in PyCharm on OSX.It's nice to have an editor window(s) on monitor A, and debug tools in monitor B, so I don't have to switch windows as much and so the debug windows have more real estate.
I'll switch back and forth between Run and Debug modes, sometimes quickly, depending on the task at hand.The main problem I find, is the tool windows for Run and Debug are separate.I have to stagger the tool windows so I can select one or the other.This requires an extra click and is an awkward arrangement on the screen.
Another option I have is to split the screen between Run and Debug tools, in which case I'm loosing real-estate.
Either way I find it's cumbersome to find the window I'm looking for.Sometimes these are hiding on a separate hidden desktop so I have to take the time to find the desktop, open the desktop, then switch to the correct tool window.
Is there any option in PyCharm to merge these two windows, either as separate tabs on the same window, or some option to have them share the same console output window?
"	"

Is there any option in PyCharm to merge these two windows

No. In the PyCharm nomenclature Run and Debug are ""tool windows"", not just windows. You can open each ""tool window"" in its own window but you can't merge 2 ""tool windows"".
Another thing are the ""toolbars"" of which you have 3, left, right and bottom. You can pin ""tool windows"" to the toolbars and they show like tabs but they are still separate and not merged, just tabs.

The main problem I find, is the tool windows for Run and Debug are separate.

That's a PyCharm rule an there's no way around it. Each of those ""tool windows"" works as a separate application/plugin. They aren't meant to be merged. The windows don't have that functionality.
The easy way to do this is using the keyboard shortcuts, Alt+4 or Alt+5 takes you to Run or Debug, Shift+F10 launches the Run config and switches focus to the Run tool window, same with Shift+F9 for the Debug tool window.
If you right-click on the toolbar and choose View Mode > Window for both tool windows you can put them on the 2nd screen over each other. That gives you maximum real-estate with 1-keyboard stroke switch and running, but not tabbed clicking.
That's as good as it gets, you can't have both tool windows tabbed on a single window outside the toolbars.

on a separate hidden desktop so I have to take the time to find the desktop, open the desktop, then switch to the correct tool window.

Having the 1-keystroke solution working would depend if the OS allows you to configure the Desktops to gain focus and come to the forefront if any of the windows in them have activity.
If not, an alternative would be a coinciding key bind where you set the Desktop containing the Run and Debug ""window toolbars"" to gain focus when you press Alt+4, Alt+5, Shift+F9, Shift+F10. Or changing the PyCharm shortcuts to coincide with the OS keyboard shortcuts that focus the designated Desktop.

I'm using Apps Script to customize my Google Sheets;
I have two different objects (one is private, the other one is public) with same properties;
They interact with each other;
Here follows an example:

function run(argument) {
let Public= {}
let Private = myClass().setFoo(argument)

Public.getFoo = Private.getFoo
return Public;
}

function myClass() {
let Public= {};
let Private = {};

Private.foo = null;

Public.setFoo = function (arg) { Private.foo = arg; return Public};
Public.getFoo = function (){ return Private.foo };
return Public;
}


I don't want setter to be available to the coder. That's why I'm doing this pattern;
The problem is: when I run it (through other function somewhere), the log displays: ""Maximum call stack size exceeded"", pointing to the Public.getFoo = Private.getFoo;
I've tried many ways to solve this, but the only thing that worked was changing the properties names, like Public.getFoo = Private._getFoo

It seams like Apps Script IDE understand both of them are the same object, so it would call itself infinetely. But why does that happen if I'm not referring to the same object?
"	"
That's a behavior that comes from JavaScript ES2015 syntax (not a Apps Script feature per se). That behavior might be different in other languages (like Java) where the object can be detected as different.
In JavaScript, there's no a native way to create private variables, but that's why we use the workaround of putting an underscore before the variable name as a convention.
There's a great article about that by Basti Ortiz that mentions how JavaScript emulates private variables

Why does printf not flush after the call unless a newline is in the format string? Is this POSIX behavior? How might I have printf immediately flush every time?
"	"
The stdout stream is line buffered by default, so will only display what's in the buffer after it reaches a newline (or when it's told to). You have a few options to print immediately:

Print to stderrinstead using fprintf (stderr is unbuffered by default):
fprintf(stderr, ""I will be printed immediately"");


Flush stdout whenever you need it to using fflush:
printf(""Buffered, will be flushed"");
fflush(stdout); // Will now print everything in the stdout buffer


Disable buffering on stdout by using setbuf:
setbuf(stdout, NULL);


Or use the more flexible setvbuf:
setvbuf(stdout, NULL, _IONBF, 0); 



............................................................
No, it's not POSIX behaviour, it's ISO behaviour (well, it is POSIX behaviour but only insofar as they conform to ISO).
Standard output is line buffered if it can be detected to refer to an interactive device, otherwise it's fully buffered. So there are situations where printf won't flush, even if it gets a newline to send out, such as:
myprog >myfile.txt

This makes sense for efficiency since, if you're interacting with a user, they probably want to see every line. If you're sending the output to a file, it's most likely that there's not a user at the other end (though not impossible, they could be tailing the file). Now you could argue that the user wants to see every character but there are two problems with that.
The first is that it's not very efficient. The second is that the original ANSI C mandate was to primarily codify existing behaviour, rather than invent new behaviour, and those design decisions were made long before ANSI started the process. Even ISO nowadays treads very carefully when changing existing rules in the standards.
As to how to deal with that, if you fflush (stdout) after every output call that you want to see immediately, that will solve the problem.
Alternatively, you can use setvbuf before operating on stdout, to set it to unbuffered and you won't have to worry about adding all those fflush lines to your code:
setvbuf (stdout, NULL, _IONBF, BUFSIZ);

Just keep in mind that may affect performance quite a bit if you are sending the output to a file. Also keep in mind that support for this is implementation-defined, not guaranteed by the standard.
ISO C99 section 7.19.3/3 is the relevant bit:

When a stream is unbuffered, characters are intended to appear from the source or at the destination as soon as possible. Otherwise characters may be accumulated and transmitted to or from the host environment as a block.
When a stream is fully buffered, characters are intended to be transmitted to or from the host environment as a block when a buffer is filled.
When a stream is line buffered, characters are intended to be transmitted to or from the host environment as a block when a new-line character is encountered.
Furthermore, characters are intended to be transmitted as a block to the host environment when a buffer is filled, when input is requested on an unbuffered stream, or when input is requested on a line buffered stream that requires the transmission of characters from the host environment.
Support for these characteristics is implementation-defined, and may be affected via the setbuf and setvbuf functions.

............................................................
It's probably like that because of efficiency and because if you have multiple programs writing to a single TTY, this way you don't get characters on a line interlaced. So if program A and B are outputting, you'll usually get:

program A output
program B output
program B output
program A output
program B output


This stinks, but it's better than

proprogrgraam m ABououtputputt
prproogrgram amB Aououtputtput
program B output


Note that it isn't even guaranteed to flush on a newline, so you should flush explicitly if flushing matters to you.
............................................................
To immediately flush call fflush(stdout) or fflush(NULL) (NULL means flush everything).
............................................................
stdout is buffered, so will only output after a newline is printed.

To get immediate output, either:


Print to stderr.
Make stdout unbuffered.

............................................................
Note: Microsoft runtime libraries do not support line buffering, so printf(""will print immediately to terminal""):

https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/cpp/c-runtime-library/reference/setvbuf
............................................................
by default, stdout is line buffered, stderr is none buffered and file is completely buffered.
............................................................
You can fprintf to stderr, which is unbuffered, instead.Or you can flush stdout when you want to.Or you can set stdout to unbuffered.
............................................................
Use setbuf(stdout, NULL); to disable buffering.
............................................................
There are generally 2 levels of buffering-

1. Kernel buffer Cache (makes read/write faster)

2. Buffering in I/O library (reduces no. of system calls)

Let's take example of fprintf and write().

When you call fprintf(), it doesn't wirte directly to the file. It first goes to stdio buffer in the program's memory. From there it is written to the kernel buffer cache by using write system call. So one way to skip I/O buffer is directly using write(). Other ways are by using setbuff(stream,NULL). This sets the buffering mode to no buffering and data is directly written to kernel buffer.
To forcefully make the data to be shifted to kernel buffer, we can use ""\n"", which in case of default buffering mode of 'line buffering', will flush I/O buffer.
Or we can use fflush(FILE *stream).

Now we are in kernel buffer. Kernel(/OS) wants to minimise disk access time and hence it reads/writes only blocks of disk. So when a read() is issued, which is a system call and can be invoked directly or through fscanf(), kernel reads the disk block from disk and stores it in a buffer. After that data is copied from here to user space.

Similarly that fprintf() data recieved from I/O buffer is written to the disk by the kernel. This makes read() write() faster.

Now to force the kernel to initiate a write(), after which data transfer is controlled by hardware controllers, there are also some ways. We can use O_SYNC or similar flags during write calls. Or we could use other functions like fsync(),fdatasync(),sync() to make the kernel initiate writes as soon as data is available in the kernel buffer.

You do not need main.java. However if what you posted is your java source code, be sure to compile it, then make the necessary class available to Java when running it.
You can run your code like so given that Java is able to find your CustomerTest.java. It should reside underneath test/cases/business (relative to the working directory) and be called CustomerTest.class.
java test.cases.business.CustomerTest

If the class resides elsewhere, you will need to point Java to the directory or ZIP/JAR file hosting that class in the same folder stucture like so:
java -cp <path to basedir> test.cases.business.CustomerTest

Virtual emulator by default is now dock with the IDE itself instead of floating window, thus I changed its View Mode to Float and later Window. Now it seems scrolling no longer works properly on both setup and I believe there is a bug going on here based on the experience I am getting. Whenever I scroll up or down using a mouse, the virtual device disappear and running it again will prompt the user that the device is already running. The question is where did the emulator go? I cannot see it on any tab either.



"	"
The emulator tool is located on the right side of the IDE. When the emulator tool is closed, the emulator is still running so you need to just click on ""Emulator"" on the right side of the IDE. However, as you mentioned, it is buggy and sometimes you have to stop the emulator and rerun to get it to display again.
However, to make things easier, you can launch the emulators in their own separate windows. It seems to be more user friendly.
To get the emulator to launch in their own windows, you have to disable the the ""Launch in a tool window"" setting. Here are the instructions to disable it.
Android Studio on Mac:
Go to Android Studio->Preferences->Tools->Emulator and then uncheck ""Launch in a tool window""
Android Studio on Windows:
Go to File->Settings->Tools->Emulator and then uncheck ""Launch in a tool window""
Now your emulators will open in their own windows and you can even open multiple emulators and view them side-by-side if you wish. With the Emulator tool, it was impossible to view multiple emulators side-by-side. Instead, you had to switch emulator tabs.
............................................................
Please press long click on power button of the emulator and then press power off.enter image description here
............................................................
make sure your source code app there is no error compiling, then just click button Run your code (not button run / play emulator), when your app delivered to emulator, your emulator appear back again

go func() {
<-terminate
fmt.Println()
fmt.Println(""CAPTURED!!!"") // want to get here when running tests from IDE
}()
exitCode := m.Run()
os.Exit(exitCode)
}

func TestSth(t *testing.T) {
time.Sleep(time.Second * 5)
}

Get the current process information by calling FindProcess on the current PID and signal the interrupt to it using Process.Signal
func TestSth(t *testing.T) {
 go func() {
 // Sleep added for demonstrative purposes, can be removed
 time.Sleep(time.Second * 1)
 p, err := os.FindProcess(os.Getpid())
 if err != nil {
 panic(err)

You can find and download many compose projects for free in Google's android official repository:
https://github.com/android/compose-samples
There is also a beautiful blog post with video and an app that you can find almost all the code you need to get started. It is about all the components you can find with Jetpack Compose according to material guidelines:
https://material.io/blog/jetpack-compose-catalog
There are not any other templates inside Android Studio about Jetpack compose. As you have one activity - no fragments. No need for Google to show you different ways of creating an app. I do not believe you will find any templates very soon - this might change of course when Jetpack Compose become mature...

Thanks in advance, im not fluent in this language, sorry.
Edit: sorry i forget to post the error line:
Service description 'http://itorrents.org/api/torrage.wsdl' can't be loaded: 500 Can't connect to itorrents.org:443

"	"
Solved ! I solved it downloading the torrage.wsdl file from http://itorrents.org/api/torrage.wsdl and replaced this line:
$infoHash = SOAP::Lite->service( 'http://itorrents.org/api/torrage.wsdl' )->cacheTorrent( $tor );

With this line(replacing the website URL with the downloaded file torrage.wsdl path):
$infoHash = SOAP::Lite->service( 'file:///C:/Users/sussq/Desktop/perl2exe/torrage.wsdl' )->cacheTorrent( $tor );

For more information and explanation see this post: SOAP::Lite can't connect to host

I am writing some logs and graphs to .log and .txt files in NodeJS.I use chalk to color my logs and help things stand out.I am also using asciichart to generate some lo-fi but very helpful graphs.
As far as I understand both of these libraries use escape sequences to color text, i.e. \x1b[32m for green, \x1b[31m for red, etc.These escape sequences, when interpereted by a terminal console, get printed as actual color.This is nicely explained in this answer to the question ""How to change node.js's console font color?""
I would like to be able to see similarly colored text within an actual text file.Obviously a text file cannot show colors, but I am wondering if a way exists to view a text file such that the escape characters are processed/parsed, and colors are shown, in the same way that happens within a terminal console.
For example, writing a colored asciichart graph to a file looks like this in vscode:

Obviously as a text file \x1b[34mâ•­\x1b[0m\x1b[34mâ”€\x1b[0m would just show up as such.
Does anyknow know of any vscode extensions, vscode custom language settings, or any other text viewers for that matter, that would be able to view a .txt or .log file, such that the escape characters are used to color the text, rather than be shown as a big text mess above?(Could this feasibly be written as a vscode extension / custom language setting?). While the question https://unix.stackexchange.com/questions/262185/display-file-with-ansi-colors has some nice hints, it ultimately only shows how to view the file in the terminal, not in a more ui-friendly file-viewer.

Well I asked this a bit prematurely.It turns out ANSI Colors vscode extension does exactly this.I'll leave this here for anyone that may have the same needs in the future.

Problem: When I just declare a variable, GoLand immediately highlights it with an error like: ""The variable is not used anywhere""; I don't like this behavior of the IDE. I have not yet had time to use it anywhere, but only announced it.
Actually, subject, tell me, please, how to remove this syntax highlighting (namely, about unused variables) in GoLand?
P.S.
There is no benefit from manipulating the: Settings -> Editor -> Inspections -> Go
"	"
This does not seem possible with Goland, of VsCode Go (which has the same behavior)
Considering an unused variable is an error for Go itself, the IDE simply reflects that.
It can be jarring though, and other Goland issues reflect this: for example, GO-2374 mentions the same kind of issue with exported functions:

All exported functions (starting with a capital letter) that are not used within a library itself, are marked as unused.
This seems odd to me. Most exported functions in a library are never used within the library itself, but I think it is wrong to mark them as unused since they are not primarily meant to be used within the library.

I still prefer the current highlight, as it makes sure I do not introduce a new variable without using as soon as possible.
............................................................
Perhaps if you have that new var, do a
_ = yourVar after that.
(Then it is in use)
Warning: scan for ""_ ="" afterwards yourself to see if you still have these.
The fact that the editor ""complains"" is just Go. Go doesn't allow you to declare vars that are not in use.

After Android Studio upgraded itself to version Arctic Fox, I now get these strange sub-windows in my code editor that I can't get rid of. If I click in either of the 2 sub-windows (a one-line window at the top or a 5-line window underneath it (see pic below), it scrolls to the code in question and the sub-windows disappear. But as soon as I navigate away from that code, these sub-windows mysteriously reappear. I can't figure out how to get rid of this.
I restarted Studio and it seemed to go away. Then I refactored a piece of code (Extract to Method Ctrl+Alt+M) and then these windows appeared again. Sometimes these windows appear on a 2nd monitor instead of on top of the code area on the monitor with Android Studio. But eventually they end up back on top of my code editor window.
I have searched hi and low for what this is. Studio help, new features, blog, etc. I am sure that I am just using the wrong terminology to find the answer, so hoping someone else knows.

"	"
Just stumbled upon the same thing (strange windows upon attempting to refactor some code after updating to Arctic Fox). After a lot of searching around the options/menus/internet this fixed it for me:
Navigate to:
File > Settings... > Editor > Code Editing
under
Refactorings > Specify refactoring options:
select
In modal dialogs
Press OK.
Fingers crossed refactoring works.

I am applying scripts in Google spreadsheets.
Using the debugger it is easy to to find errors in the script that is local to the spreadsheet (container). In the script I use functions of external libraries, which is running fine.
However, when using the debugger I am not able anymore to enter the library script. The debugger works fine as long as the script is local. But as soon as an external function is called I get an error

Cannot connect to server

when entering the code.
Using the execute command from within the debugger works fine.
Question
In the past I was able to use the debugging function also to debug library functions. Somehow this has changed.
Does anyone know what the reason is?
"	"
As per checking, it seems this is a well-known bug. Check Cannot debug library, debugger does not step in for details and bump the issue if you can.
You might also want to try and check if you can do it via the old IDE.
EDIT:
As per RubÃ©n, seems like it also doesn't work on the old IDE too.

just want to ask a quick question;
Essentially, I want to know if it's possible to hide Python class private methods from the list of suggestions that Visual Studio Code or other IDEs provide.
For instance, suppose that we have a class ""A"":
# Creating a class
class A:

# Declaring public method
def fun(self):
print(""Public method"")

# Declaring private method
def __fun(self):
print(""Private method"")

# Calling private method via
# another method
def Help(self):
self.fun()
self.__fun()

Now, we don't want Visual Studio Code or other IDEs to show the method ""__fun"" in the list of suggestions provided by the IDE, how can we do that?
I can see that even though ""__fun"" has been declared as private method inside class ""A"", Visual Studio code will still suggest it in its snippet:

Would it be possible to get rid of this?
"	"
I may have found a partial solution to your question, which may help
There is a python language setting in vscode that, if enabled, reports an usage of 'protected' function (started with underscore) outside of the class.
Press CTRL+SHIFT+P, type ""Configure Language Specific Settings"" and select Python. In JSON object add the following property:
""python.analysis.diagnosticSeverityOverrides"": {
""reportPrivateUsage"": ""error""
}


source: code.visualstudio.com/docs/python/settings-reference
............................................................
You could simulate private methods using a method registration class but it will require tagging both the private methods and the public methods that are allowed to access them:
class PrivateMethods:

def __init__(self):
self.methods = dict()

def __call__(self,f):
name = inspect.getsource(f).split(""def "",1)[-1]
name = name.split(""("")[0].strip()
self.methods[name]=f# register private method
del(f)# and remove it from class

def access(self,f):
def withAccess(obj,*args,**kwargs):
obj.__inPrivate += 1# internal depth counter
try: result = f(obj,*args,**kwargs) # around public calls
finally: obj.__inPrivate -= 1 
return result
return withAccess

def method(self,instance,name):
if name == '_PrivateMethods__inPrivate': return 0
if name in self.methods and instance.__inPrivate:
f = self.methods[name]
return lambda *args,**kwargs:f(instance,*args,**kwargs)
else: 
raise AttributeError(f'{type(instance)} has no {name} attribute')

You class will need to have an instance of PrivateMethods to hold the names and code of the private methods outside of the class itself.By defining the __getattr__ to access the private methods, you prevent any use of these methods outside of the class's code.The PrivateMethods object stores the name and code of private methods. It also removes them from the class (after being defined).
With this, you don't need to use the double underline naming convention to hide private methods (although it is still a good practice to do so)
Usage:
class myClass:

# boiler plate code to use in your class
private = PrivateMethods() 
def __getattr__(self,name):
return myClass.private.method(self,name)

def privMethod(self,a):
print('in private',a,type(self)) 
private(privMethod) # register/remove private

@private.access # allow access to privates
def pubMethod(self):
self.privMethod(""from pubMethod"")

c = myClass()
c.pubMethod()
# in private from pubMethod <class '__main__.myClass'>

c.privMethod(""from outside"")
# AttributeError: <class '__main__.myClass'> has no privMethod attribute

Forgive me if this is a really stupid question, but I haven't found any answers yet - or maybe I don't know the correct thing to ask for.
Given the following files that are part of the same project:

MyProject.html
MyProject.css
MyProject.js

(and a MyProject.py that runs on the server to make things happen)
. . . where all three of these items are related and are actually part of a single project and they need to integrate together.
The ""html"" part of VS code makes sure the html is correct.
The ""css"" part of VS code makes sure the css is correct.
the JavaScript part of VS code makes sure the javascript is correct.
However, they may not be correct together as a unified whole - I may have changed something in the javascript that references something in the html that may not yet exist - because I forgot to write it, and I don't discover this until I launch things and watch the web-page go all pear-shaped in ways I've never heard of before.
Is there something that will take all these pieces and say ""Hey!You changed the definition of this element here in the Javascript but not in the HTML (or the CSS or whatever)
In other words, not only do I want to know if the individual files are syntactically correct, but do they agree with each other?
If there is a ""something"" that does this, what is it called?
"	"
That tool will never exist and for good reasons, it'd slow the living hell out of your computer when programming and wouldn't fair well as a best practice. Though it's cool, it's cooler to write code effectively and not have a slow code editor. So to that suggestion is write your JavaScript and HTML together hand in hand; split view and you won't ever have an issue. CSS can come into play any time.
Your best option for knowing if code is correct, would be a linter but that won't help you with the issues you face if you're calling elements that don't exist or did you'll want to improve how you code these functions/events.
As requested submitted as an answer for the OP.

I would like to have the exact same setup of jupyterlab in every new anaconda environment. Just like I can define some default packages to be installed when creating an environment with
conda config --add create_default_packages package1 package2
I would like to install a few jupyterlab extensions. I can install them by using the command
jupyter labextension install,
but this is a jupyterlab command and not a conda one. Is there a way of creating a script, that would execute only once after creating an environment, or some other mechanism that would let me automate this process?
"	"
With JupyterLab 3+.0+ you should not need to install extensions with jupyter labextension install; instead installation with pip install or conda install is now the recommended approach for most users (see documentation).
Extensions installable with pip/conda* do not require Node.js and are therefore more robust and user-friendly; we call them ""prebuilt extensions"", in contrast to the old ""source extensions"". We are considering removing support for installing source extensions by end users in a future version of JupyterLab (but not for advanced users and system administrators who should still be able to access this mechanism) as source extensions proved to be causing more trouble than benefit for an average user, and users so far were happy with the transition.
Please also see:

Unable to install jupyterlab-execute-time extension
RuntimeError: JupyterLab failed to build

If extension is not on conda-forge you can always contribute a recipe for it. If that's the case let me know and I can help you with the next steps.

I've worked on my python project in PyCharm. When I'm executing its different files everything goes smoothly. However, when I'm executing the files in shell, it seems like I get errors that I don't get in the IDE.
For example, being a simplified structure of my project:
+--PROJECT
 +--data
+--myfile.csv
 +--__init__.py
 +--main.py

And being a simplified main.py:
import pandas as pd

if __name__ == ""__main__"":
 dataframe = pd.read_csv(""data/myfile.csv"", on_bad_lines='skip', sep=sep)

The execution in PyCharm is clean, while when I run it in Shell it yields:
TypeError: parser_f() got an unexpected keyword argument 'on_bad_lines'

I guess this could be a matter ofPython versions, but I don't quite see where the problem is. I have a 3.8 version inPyCharm and a 3.8.10 inLinux.
EDITED: Included the source file and its path
"	"
What version of pandas do you use? According to this documentation the on_bad_lines is only added in 1.3.0. You can check that by using
$ python# start an interpreter
>>> import pandas
>>> print(pandas.__version__)

I think you are trying to mix java with javascript. Push is not function for array in java . You can obtain the same result using the following code.
import java.io.*;
import java.lang.*;
import java.util.*;

class gradeCalc {

// Function to add x in arr
public static double[] addX(int n, double arr[], double x) {
int i;

// create a new array of size n+1
double newarr[] = new double[n + 1];

// insert the elements from
// the old array into the new array
// insert all elements till n
// then insert x at n+1
for (i = 0; i < n; i++)
newarr[i] = arr[i];

newarr[n] = x;

return newarr;
}

public static void main(String args[]) {
double[] grade = { 89, 89.2, 44.2, 69.6, 79.2, 54.2 };
int count;
int i;
double[] Agroup = {};
double[] Bgroup = {};
double[] Cgroup = {};
double[] Dgroup = {};
double[] Fgroup = {};
count = 0;

for (i = 0; i < grade.length; i++) {
if (grade[i] >= 80) {
count = count + 1;

// Agroup.push(grade[i]);
Agroup = addX(Agroup.length, Agroup, grade[i]);
} else if (grade[i] >= 70) {
count = count + 1;
Bgroup = addX(Bgroup.length, Agroup, grade[i]);
} else if (grade[i] >= 60) {
count = count + 1;

Cgroup = addX(Cgroup.length, Cgroup, grade[i]);
} else if (50 <= grade[i] && grade[i] < 60) {
count = count + 1;

Dgroup = addX(Dgroup.length, Dgroup, grade[i]);
} else {
count = count + 1;
Fgroup = addX(Fgroup.length, Fgroup, grade[i]);
}

}
System.out.println(""The total count is: "" + count);
System.out.println(""A group : "" + Arrays.toString(Agroup));
System.out.println(""B group : "" + Arrays.toString(Bgroup));
System.out.println(""C group : "" + Arrays.toString(Cgroup));
System.out.println(""D group : "" + Arrays.toString(Dgroup));
System.out.println(""F group : "" + Arrays.toString(Fgroup));

I am currently learning C and I am using Code Blocks. I think that VS as an IDE is more modern and would run better. So I have 2 questions. Does VS support C? And if so, is it worth it moving from Codeblocks to VS? I mean Codeblocks is built to run C but while VS isn't, so will I gain anything from changing my IDE?
Thanks in adavnce

In Visual Studio you can use any compiler. Visual Studio has also built in very nice Cmake & VC support.
If you want to compile as C using standard msvc compiler you need to set it in the project properties:

The only problem is that msvc still does not fully support C99 features.
If you want to use gcc you need to set it up in the project properties (this example is for g++ and C++ but you simply need to change the compiler.

There is plenty information on the net how to set the intellisense to be gcc & clang compatible (VS uses Edison Design Group intellisense)
............................................................
Yes, in Visual Studio you can compile and execute your C programmes and I will say it was not worth it as we are learners and IDE's has tons of features which will make you confused and because of the autocomplete we can't practice properly '_'.

You probably entered Column Selection Mode via an accidental click in the editor context menu (at least that happens to me occasionally). To exit the mode again, just right-click in the editor and select Column Selection Mode (which will have a check mark in front of it).

But with my last update, when I click on the file in the EXPLORER and press Ctrl+F, I am now getting this NEW small tool in the EXPLORER pane, and the cursor goes THERE. I type away and nothing happens in the file editor until I swear a few near-curse-words and have to click over in the file editor and then press Ctrl+F again and start all over to type the search string. It's bugging me because its old habit.

How can I go back to the old way of how it worked? Is there a simple configuration buried somewhere I can change?
Thanks.

I don't say see a setting to set the old filter-search method as the default in the Explorer.You can disable the list.find command on which the new find widget in the Explorer depends in your keybindings.json which has the effect you want:
{
""key"": ""ctrl+f"",
""command"": ""-list.find"",
// ""when"": ""listFocus && listSupportsFind""
}

Now Ctrl+F with focus in the Explorer will open the editor Find Widget with focus.
But you lose the ability to filter other lists with the Ctrl+F, such as TreeViews (see https://stackoverflow.com/a/73039598/836330 forexample).

The better solution, IMO, is to set up a macro which works when you have explorerFocus and use the Ctrl+F keybinding.You will need a macro extension, like multi-command.Use this keybinding in your keybindings.json:
{
""key"": ""ctrl+f"",
""command"": ""extension.multiCommand.execute"",
""args"": {
""sequence"": [
""workbench.action.focusActiveEditorGroup"",
""actions.find"",
],
""when"": ""explorerFocus""
},
}

which will switch focus to your current editor and then open the Find Widget therein.

In IntelliJ IDEA is there a way to highlight the files changed on a current branch (i.e. all files changed in your previous commits) in the project section?
Obviously the git/history tab can be used to see the files but it is pretty cumbersome as it opens the diff instead of the actual file.
It's nice to just be able to quickly see the files you've been working with show up a different colour. I usually hold off on committing my changes until I'm nearly finished on something just so I can easily see the files I've been working with recently.
"	"
See whether this works for you.
Open Git history, click one of the commit, then on the right page, right click and select ""Edit Source"", it will open all the files that were changed/updated/added on the Tab editor.

I get the following error message when running some code in Google Apps Script. I don't understand the Line/Column reference, Code:46:18. It appears to point to either a line with too few columns or a process with too few lines. I assume I am not interpreting the reference correctly.
TypeError: Cannot set property 'format' of undefined
at processInbox(processInbox Code:46:18)

Line 46 of all my code is this and certainly doesn't have 18 columns (and it closes a function that doesn't refer to format):
}

The process referred to by the error message, processInbox, is only 39 lines long.
The script is called by selecting ""Run Script"" in the menu, ""CiviSchedule"" in the related Google Sheet, which triggers the doTasks function. This menu and and trigger are created in the onOpen function.
How am I misinterpreting the error message? (Full code follows)

at processInbox(processInbox Code:46:18)

The syntax is

at ${FUNCTION}(${FILE}:${LINE}:${COLUMN})

This would suggest that the code causing the error is elsewhere.
At file

processInbox Code

within function

processInbox

And at line

46

and at column

18

You probably have a same function name processInbox at a different file named processInbox Code. In that file, at line 46, col 18, you'll have your error.

I think that you problem may be that this line:
var data = sheet.getRange(3, 1, sheet.getLastRow(), COL.total).getValues();
should be like this:

I'm just familiarizing myself with QT Creator, and so I may use incorrect terminology.I've been trying to research this myself, but must not be choosing my keywords properly.
I'm trying to find the location of the setting or preference within the Creator 8.0.1 IDE that allows me to see different properties of a selected object's colors instead of the one's presented by default.
Instead of this:


I'm hoping for this:

Also, and likely related, when I click the ""Color"" in the current setup, the Color Select Dialog that appears looks like this:

Is it possible, and I think it may fix itself if the properties color options issue above is solved, to have the default selector be this one?

If I double-click on an object within the design window, I get that selector, but if I click on the color within the properties panel, then I get the previous one.
I'm happy to provide any other info you may need:

Qt Creator 8.0.1

QML imports:

import QtQuick 2.15
import QtQuick.Window 2.15
import QtQuick.Controls 2.15

"	"
The ColorEditor you're showing is the Qt Design Studio custom ColorEditor for the PropertyEditor. This was a change made in QtDS 2.2 release.
The first image is showing the integrated minimal color editor in the PropertyEditor, the second one is showing the old (pre QtDS 2.2) ColorEditor that needed a complete section. The decision was made that it needed a slimmer version of the ColorEditor and the full ColorEditor on demand. The third image is showing the new full ColorEditor of QtDS.
You can get the operation system ColorDialog in the new version of the QtDS ColorEditor by right-clicking on the ColorPicker in the full ColorEditor and choosing ""Open Color Dialog"" from the context menu.

Until somewhat recently, using the ""Delete to Word End"" functionality in IntelliJ IDEA (macOS keyboard shortcut: âŒ¥âŒ¦) would delete through the end of the current line as well as any leading whitespace on the next line before the first word:
Line 1
 Line 2

=>
Line1Line2

This changed within the last year or two to keep the leading whitespace from the next line:
Line 1
 Line 2

=>
Line1 Line2

I much prefer the previous behavior.While cleaning up code for readability, I'll often pull code that is split across multiple lines onto one line using this functionality.What was previously one set of keystrokes is now two (I need to use the ""Delete to Word End"" key combination twice).What's worse, if the next line happens to not have leading whitespace, I have to override the muscle memory and only type the shortcut once, or else I'll delete part or all of the code on the following line.
As a minimalistic yet realistic example, I might use this behavior to do the following code transformation:
List<String> myList = otherList.stream()
.map(this::aMethod)
.toList();

=>
List<String> myList = otherList.stream()
.map(this::aMethod).toList();

I don't know what version specifically the change occurred, but I have a version of IntelliJ IDEA from 2016 which has the old functionality, and one 2021 with the new functionality.I think the change happened in 2020 or 2021.
Is there a way to revert the behavior to the previous functionality (or perhaps an equivalent functionality under a different name)?
"	"
While it's not exactly the same functionality, the Join Lines action (âŒƒâ‡§J on macOS) accomplishes the same goal in many cases.Regardless of where the caret is on the current line, it joins the current line to the next line, in context-sensitive ways.
For the given Java method call example, it has exactly the intended behavior of moving the method call to the current line without any spaces:
List<String> myList = otherList.stream()
.map(this::aMethod)
.toList();

=>
List<String> myList = otherList.stream()
.map(this::aMethod).toList();

For a concatenated Java string split over the two lines, it will remove the string concatenation operator, combining the two strings into one:
System.out.println(""A"" +
""B"");

=>
System.out.println(""AB"");

In a plain text file, it will combine the lines, with a single space before the non-space text of the second line:
Line 1
 Line 2

=>
Line 1 Line 2

I was interested to know if the code markers shown at the end of some lines (see screenshot) are explained or documented anywhere (for RAD Studio 10.4).
I notice that the first 3 (for Halt, Continue and Break) will disappear when these items are prefixed with the unit name System..
As for raise, it's not clear to me what the little red up arrow signifies or how it should be addressed. Code compiles fine without errors, warnings or hints.
procedure TForm1.FormCreate(Sender: TObject);
var
I: Integer;
begin
if False then Halt(99);

for I := 0 to 2 do
begin
if I = 0 then Continue;
if I = 1 then Break;
end;

try
Transaction.StartTransaction;
//update database
Transaction.Commit;
except
Transaction.Rollback;
raise;
end;
end;


"	"
Those arrows belong to Flow Control Highlighting. They are visual cues that illustrate jumps (interruptions) in the regular, linear, code flow.
For instance, Break arrow points down and it visually shows that code execution will jump out of the current loop down to the first next code line outside the loop.
raise arrow symbolizes jumping out of the current code (bubbling up) to the next exception handler.
The fact some of them disappear when they are prefixed with System namespace is merely a bug in the parser responsible for painting the highlighting. Actual behavior of the code will be the same.

Maybe it's just me being unable to formulate the question in such a way as to find an answer on google. Maybe it's a common thing, maybe it's not.
All I can say is that I'm working on my fifth microservice, and all five of them have had the same exact issue.
Project view has no issue. I've even enabled Project-Wide Analysis.
But mapstruct classes (be it interfaces or abstracts), but not configs. Just classes that will eventually end up generating code. They all get a red squiggly underline.
If I don't click the class and build or run, everything is fine.
If I do a gradle clean build - everything is fine.
If I do a gradle clean to remove generated classes - everything is fine.
But no matter which of the above steps I do, the red squiggly line does not go away.
However when I double-click the class (to open it in the editor and see what the issue is) ... everything is suddenly fine. No error, no problem, no nothing. For like a minute till they get underlined again.
The gutter red line for the project view gives me no popup to suggest what the issue is. And, again, the problem view is empty.
I have no idea what to do. It's driving me nuts!
EDIT
I did find one error, in the Auto-Build tab of the IDE, it only really says:

System.out.println(standard());
}
if (operator.equals(""2"")) {
System.out.println(scientific());
}
if (operator.equals(""QUIT"")) {
System.out.print(""System quit"");

}
}
public static int standard() {
//The system will print 0 at the end to show that it's working
System.out.println(""Standard Calculator chosen."");
System.out.println(""Type 1 if you wish to use addition, 2 for subtraction, 3 for multiplication, 4 for exponent, 5 for division, or 6 for mod."");

You need to do something as follows, as you want to repeat all the process until the user choose to QUIT the calculator app:
public static void main(String[] args) {
System.out.println(""Welcome to my calculator:"");
String operator = """";

while (!operator.equals(""QUIT"")) {

Scanner op = new Scanner(System.in);
System.out.println(""Type 1 if you wish to use the Standard calculator, 2 for the Scientific calculator, or QUIT if you wish to quit the program."");
operator = op.nextLine();
if (operator.equals(""1"")) {
System.out.println(standard());
}
if (operator.equals(""2"")) {
System.out.println(scientific());
}
if (operator.equals(""QUIT"")) {
System.out.print(""System quit"");

}

}
}

output:
Welcome to my calculator:
Type 1 if you wish to use the Standard calculator, 2 for the Scientific calculator, or QUIT if you wish to quit the program.
1
Standard Calculator chosen.
Type 1 if you wish to use addition, 2 for subtraction, 3 for multiplication, 4 for exponent, 5 for division, or 6 for mod.
1

1
Please enter the second value: 
2
Addition - (1+2) = 3
0
Type 1 if you wish to use the Standard calculator, 2 for the Scientific calculator, or QUIT if you wish to quit the program.


............................................................
Here's a solution for your ""main"" method that:

uses a ""while"" loop and a boolean value ""keepGoing"" to decide if it should loop again (or exit)
uses a ""switch"" statement to handle calling different functions based on input
if ""QUIT"" input, it sets ""keepGoing = false"" so that the ""while"" loop will exit
defines one Scanner, and names it clearly (""scanner"")
passes that single Scanner object to the methods which need it (standard and scientific)

Two other changes worth making:

remove the global static Scanner s1 â€?don't use global variables, it will lead to hard-to-find problems in your code
edit those method signatures to accept a Scanner parameter:
public static int standard(Scanner s1)`
public static double scientific(Scanner s1)



Here's the code:
Scanner scanner = new Scanner(System.in);
System.out.println(""Welcome to my calculator:"");

String prompt = ""Type 1 if you wish to use the Standard calculator, "" +
""2 for the Scientific calculator, or "" +
""QUIT if you wish to quit the program."";

boolean keepGoing = true;
while (keepGoing) {
System.out.println(prompt);
switch (scanner.nextLine()) {
case ""1"" -> System.out.println(standard(scanner));
case ""2"" -> System.out.println(scientific(scanner));
case ""QUIT"" -> {
System.out.print(""System quit"");
keepGoing = false; // this ejects from the while loop
}
}
}

I've created a script using Apps Script in Google Sheets, and would like to code in TypeScript.I gather to do this you need to rename the default .gs file to .ts.
How does one accomplish that in the online IDE?It doesn't seem to let you rename the extension:

I tried the ""classic editor"" with similar results.I don't want to install Node (which requires Administrator privileges) and CLASP (which requires granting access to my Google account) just to rename a file!
There are hints the online editor supports TypeScript (e.g. autocomplete lists parameter types):

But if I try creating typed variables or parameters in my .gs file I get linter and syntax errors:


"	"
Typescript is currently not supported in Apps script editor. There is however, a feature request for the same here: https://issuetracker.google.com/issues/238057231

Say you are editing code in one IDE and want to open the same file and place the caret at the same place in the other IDE. How would you do that between Pycharm and VSCode?
Is there a pair of extensions for that? Or a standard way of noting said place so that you can copy it from one IDE and paste it into the other?
I've looked around but couldn't find any info (maybe I didn't hit the right keywords).
"	"
Okay, so I found an answer for the direction Pycharm -> VSCode:
In Pycharm:
Hit Edit > Copy Path/Reference > Path With Line Number.
You should get a path of the form path/to/file:lineNumber.
In VSCode:
Hit Ctrl + P (command palette) > Ctrl + V (paste) > Enter.
I haven't looked for the other way around (VSCode -> Pycharm), yet.

I'm trying to setup local Windows eclipse for remote Linux development. I have encountered problem with eclipse not recognizing simple 'printf()' statement from <stdio.h>. I didn't find any helpful resources ATM to solve this problem, so wondering if you could help me with this.

Header files used from: Visual Studio Build Tools 2022, specifically I'm including this folder for stdio.h file: 'C:\Program Files (x86)\Windows Kits\10\Include\10.0.19041\ucrt'



GCC C++ Compiler as: ""C:\Program Files (x86)\Microsoft Visual Studio\2022\BuildTools\VC\Tools\Llvm\bin\clang.exe""


Eclipse IDE still highlights this as 'Function cannot be resolved':

I am not sure, but looks like 'printf' function is available at 'stdio.h':

Update:

Eclipse version used:

Using command line build is working as expected:

Program runs as expected:


So the questions are:
What needs to be done so eclipse would recognize 'printf'? e.g. Change MS Win Kits for another compiler header files? Or my eclipse configs are wrong?
If it is not possible for eclipse to recognize 'printf', is there an option to ignore all warnings on 'printf' (not highlight them)?
Let me know would you need anymore details from my side.

After some investigation I think 'clang' is not compatible with eclipse & it's way easier to install & use 'cygwin' for such purposes.

I dont know if this is a bug or something, but I simply cant remove the TS error in my IDE (Webstorm).
The error appears when I am using Array.prototype.at() on any kind of array.
tsconfig.json:
""lib"": [
""DOM"",
""ES2020"",
""ESNext""
],

But this seems not to work, I also added ES2021 - ES2015 but the error keeps on. It does work when I compile it, but I just get the error in the IDE.
Does anybody know how to fix this?


const arr = [""hello"", 5, true, {name: ""test""}];

console.log(arr.at(0));
console.log(arr.at(1));
console.log(arr.at(-1));
console.log(arr.at(-2));

Array.at requires ES2022 target which is available from TS 4.6 onwards.

Super strange thing just happened. In the middle of my project running, it crashed and I was left with this error:
Error: EPERM: operation not permitted, uv_cwd
at process.wrappedCwd [as cwd] (node:internal/bootstrap/switches/does_own_process_state:126:28)
...

All of the files on the lefthand side of the editor disappeared. Was just weird, so I closed VS Code and navigated to the folder and used the code . shell command to open it up again as I normally would; however, this error again.
It literally came out of nowhere - I ran my program, got up to grab my coffee, came back 2 minutes later and was left with this. I have already tried:

Uninstalling and reinstalling VS Code
Running npm cache clean with the --force flag.

No luck though. Anyone have any ideas? I can't find anything online.

It's a long shot, but since you're probably using MacOS, it could very well be related to an anti virus. Seems plausible for your case as it's coming completely out of the blue.
If you use && in bash, it spawns the process in a different way than using code . standalone. So it's possibly flagged as dangerous only with && by anti virus, which might explain the difference you're observing in your edit.
Keep in mind that there is a chance you actually have a malicious package installed and it's rightly being picked up. A small chance, but malicious packages do exist on NPM. These recent discoveries might also have resulted in more anti virus rules and scanning of JS packages, which in turn make false positives more likely.
On a similar question there are also reports of this as a cause.
If it's not related to that, the question has plenty other answers you can try.
You didn't mention whether you tried rebooting. Since you updated the question saying ""it's back"", I assume it just stopped occurring previously. When did it do so? Was if after a reboot?
............................................................
I had a similar issue recently but after winding about for a while I realized this; I was running the npm start command from the bin directory. This happens when you delete a very valuable file and somehow the package manager searches the bin for the file. To resolve this try to change the directory into your working folder and make sure you've got all the necessary files available ie the index.js etc. It should work from here on end.

I have a very simple Python program.
def square(a):
for i in a:
yield i*i

def main():
a = [1, 2, 3]
b = square(a)
print(b)
print(next(b))
print(next(b))
print(next(b))
print(next(b))


if __name__ == ""__main__"":
main()

When I run it from the command line, I got the following result, which is what I was expecting.

I run it many times and the result is always the same. However, when I use IntelliJ IDEA with Python plugin to run the same program, I got this:

Why does this happen? How to get a stable result in IntelliJ IDEA?
"	"
The Kemp's explanation is correct.
There is a corresponding ticket in PyCharm issue tracker https://youtrack.jetbrains.com/issue/PY-37396
See also https://youtrack.jetbrains.com/issue/PY-32776
As a possible workaround, you can enable Emulate terminal in output console option for your run configuration (Run | Edit Configurations...).
............................................................
The issue here is that the print output goes to stdout while the exception message goes to stderr. In your terminal they get output as-is, but the IDE is likely doing some buffering on stdout for efficiency reasons. The same buffer won't apply to stderr because it needs to make sure that output gets on the screen asap and without risking the buffer being prematurely cleared out. This means that sometimes (quite often in my experience) exception messages like yours will appear before normal output that you'd expect to already have been shown.

Background: I am working with Angular (but my problem is not particular to any language or framework). In Angular, each component requires four separate files. So, we often find ourselves with 40+ files open. But, most of these files can be tiny, less than 20 lines each.
Many IDEs allow you to open your files in multiple windows. Each window can have a different panel, and each panel can have different tabs. This is great, but honestly, still isn't enough.
What I want: In addition to windows, panels, and tabs, I'd like to add another level of organization.
I speculate this has probably existed for decades, but I just don't know what it's called. At the very least, I speculate this has existed at least since Angular was a thing.
For example, here is a screenshot of VSCode with four files open across four panels. (Code taken from Angular dynamic component tutorial):

And here is a quick mockup showing what I'm looking for. Four files are open, but the three shortest ones are ""concatenated"" into one editor. Arrow-key down from the bottom of one file will bring you to the first line of the next file.

Notably, these files are not actually concatenated on-disk.
TLDR: What text editor can allow me to edit multiple files as if they were concatenated, as in the mockup above?
"	"
If the files stay as separate windows/tabs, the file editor would have to shrink each tab to a minimal height, and then tile them vertically. If any editor can do it, I suspect it would be emacs or vim. You might also be able to do it by opening separate editor windows and using a tiling window manager.
We can achieve a similar effect with some text editing magic. It would be something like:

Add a header to each file consisting of a unique separator (e.g. # === magic separator === filename my_file.js ===)
Use cat to combine all the files into one file
Edit this one file
When done, use the separator to break them up and put the text back into the original files

You could easily write some scripts for combining and splitting so you can do it quickly. You can also set up a background script that automatically runs the splitter as you edit the combined file. However, the combined file would essentially be a new file, so you could not view changes on it with git, and VS Code's CodeLens/Inline blame wouldn't work.
One option would be to develop your codebase with the combined files checked in to VCS, and then only have the splitter script as part of your ""build"" step. So you would make your changes, run ./build.sh which splits the files into some temp directory, and then run your application from there.
Lastly, and I hate to be snide, but the fact is that this problem is best solved by avoiding poorly designed frameworks that do not consider developer ergonomics. Many other languages give the developer much freedom and many tools to organize their code as they wish, rather than imposing constraints like requiring many small components to be in separate files. Java for example also had a similar problem (dunno if more recent versions fixed it) - you can only have one class per file, which creates a huge mess if you like having many small files. C# does not have this limitation and as a result C# codebases can be much tidier than Java codebases.

Does VSCode have the ability to tab out of auto-completed brackets? As in, when you press ""tab"" key near a closing bracket, the cursor will jump over it instead of adding a new tab. This is a feature in Pycharm and I am used to it. But in VSCode you must use arrow keys to do so.

I set up netBeans and a SceneBuilder on my new MacBook M1 and everything works, except of the font when running the program.
It looks like this:

and I have no clue why.
The Button should say: ""Click me"" and the Label: ""Hello"".
The Error message I get is:

I also had the same issue, but in my case, the problem was with JDK 11. First, I tried to switch to JDK 8 and everything worked fine, but then I found that another version of JDK 11 (AdoptOpenJDK(HotSpot) 11) also fixes it.
............................................................
In my case that crap came up when I run programm on mac (on pc was all good).
For me shortest way to solve this was one record in stylesheet:
.root{
-fx-font-size: 11pt;
-fx-font-family: ""Arial"";
}

............................................................
In my case, I was using the JavaFX 11 with the JDK11 and that was giving the weird characters, so I changed it to JavaFX 16 and also started using the JDK16 and that fixed my problem!
............................................................
I have also switched my Module setting back to : 11.0.8 instead of 11.0.12 as shown below:

............................................................
I was able to resolve the issue by adjusting the JDK version. Although I did not have JDK 8, JDK 14 worked fine and JDK 17 did not. It will work fine if you change the project structure to a more compatible JDK version with JavaFX.
............................................................
You can install the AdoptOpenJDK from this link https://formulae.brew.sh/cask/adoptopenjdk
(Note: you need to have Brew installed).
Then you go to the project module settings and then go to 'Project'.
There you will see the label 'SDK'. Click there and next select 'Add JDK'.
It will redirect you to the JDKs and next select the 'AdoptOpenJDk' folder.

tldr: I downgraded to JDK 17 (17.0.2) and now it works...
I was watching a beginners Java tutorial by Kody Simpson on YT (youtube.com/watch?v=t9LP9Nt9Nco), and in that tutorial the boy Kody prints crazy symbols called Unicode like ""â˜¯Î©Ã¸áš™"", but for me it just prints ""?"" - a question mark.
char letter = '\u1699';
System.out.println(letter);

I tried pretty much every solution on Stack Overflow, such as:

Changing File Encoding to UTF-8, although mine was using UTF-8 by default.
Putting '-Dconsole.encoding=UTF-8' and '-Dfile.encoding=UTF-8' in the Edit Custom VM options.
Messing with Region Settings in control panel.

None of it worked.
Every post was also from many years ago, such as this one, which is from 12 years:
unicode characters appear as question marks in IntelliJ IDEA console
I ended up deleting and re-downloading Intellij because I thought I messed up some settings and wanted a restart, but this time I made the Project SDK an older version, Oracle openJDK version 14.0.1, and now somehow it worked and printed the 'áš? symbol.
Then I realized the problem might be the latest version of the JDK which is version 18, so I downloaded JDK 17.0.2, and it BOOM it still works and prints out the symbol 'áš?, so thats nice :). But when I switched back to JDK version 18 it just prints ""?"" again.
Also its strange because I can copy paste the áš?symbol into the writing code area whatever you call it, (on JDK version 18)
char letter = 'áš?;
System.out.println(letter);

But when I press RUN and try to PRINT ... it STILL GIVES QUESTION MARK.
I have no clue why this happens, I started learning coding 2 days so I'm probably dumb, or the new version has got a bug, but I never found a solution through Google or here, so this is why I'm making my first ever Stack Overflow post.

I can replicate your problem: printing works correctly when running your code if compiled with JDK 17, and fails when running your code if compiled with JDK 18.
One of the changes implemented in Java 18 was JEP 400: UTF-8 by Default. The summary for that JEP stated:

Specify UTF-8 as the default charset of the standard Java APIs. With
this change, APIs that depend upon the default charset will behave
consistently across all implementations, operating systems, locales,
and configurations.

That sounds good, except one of the goals of that change was (with my emphasis added):

Standardize on UTF-8 throughout the standard Java APIs, except for
console I/O.

So I think your problem arose because you had ensured that the console's encoding in Intellij IDEA was UTF-8, but the PrintStream that you were using to write to that console (i.e. System.out) was not.
The Javadoc for PrintStream states (with my emphasis added):

All characters printed by a PrintStream are converted into bytes using
the given encoding or charset, or the default charset if not
specified.

Since your PrintStream was System.out, you had not specified any ""encoding or charset"", and were therefore using the ""default charset"", which was presumably not UTF-8. So to get your code to work on Java 18, you just need to ensure that your PrintStream is encoding with UTF-8. Here's some sample code to show the problem and the solution:
package pkg;

import java.io.FileDescriptor;
import java.io.FileOutputStream;
import java.io.PrintStream;
import java.nio.charset.StandardCharsets;

public class Humpty {

public static void main(String[] args) throws java.io.UnsupportedEncodingException {

char letter = 'áš?;
String charset1 = System.out.charset().displayName();// charset() requires JDK 18

System.out.println(""Writing the character "" + letter + "" to a PrintStream with charset "" + charset1); // fails

PrintStream ps = new PrintStream(new FileOutputStream(FileDescriptor.out), true, StandardCharsets.UTF_8);
String charset2 = ps.charset().displayName(); // charset() requires JDK 18
ps.println(""Writing the character "" + letter + "" to a PrintStream with charset "" + charset2); // works
}
}

This is the output in the console when running that code:
C:\Java\jdk-18\bin\java.exe -javaagent:C:\Users\johndoe\AppData\Local\JetBrains\Toolbox\apps\IDEA-U\ch-0\221.5080.93\lib\idea_rt.jar=64750:C:\Users\johndoe\AppData\Local\JetBrains\Toolbox\apps\IDEA-U\ch-0\221.5080.93\bin -Dfile.encoding=UTF-8 -classpath C:\Users\johndoe\IdeaProjects\HelloIntellij\out\production\HelloIntellij pkg.Humpty
Writing the character ? to a PrintStream with charset windows-1252
Writing the character áš?to a PrintStream with charset UTF-8

Process finished with exit code 0

Notes:

PrintStream has a new method in Java 18 named charset() which ""returns the charset used in this PrintStream instance"". The code above calls charset(), and shows that for my machine my ""default charset"" is windows-1252, not UTF-8.
I used Intellij IDEA 2022.1 Beta (Ultimate Edition) for testing.
In the console I used font DejaVu Sans to ensure that the character ""áš? could be rendered."																															
																																	
																																	
UPDATE: To address the issue raised in the comments below by Mostafa Zeinali	 the PrintStream used by System.out can be redirected to a UTF-8 PrintStream by calling System.setOut(). Here's sample code:																																
String charsetOut = System.out.charset().displayName();																																	
"if (!""""UTF-8"""".equals(charsetOut)) {"																																	
"System.out.println(""""The charset for System.out is """" + charsetOut + """". Changing System.out to use charset UTF-8"""");"																																	
System.setOut(new PrintStream(new FileOutputStream(FileDescriptor.out)	 true																																
"System.out.println(""""The charset for System.out is now """" +System.out.charset().displayName());"																																	
}																																	
																																	
This is the output from that code on my Windows 10 machine:																																	
The charset for System.out is windows-1252. Changing System.out to use charset UTF-8																																	
The charset for System.out is now UTF-8																																	
																																	
Note that System.out is a final variable	" so you can't directly assign a new PrintStream to it. This code fails to compile with the error """"Cannot assign a value to final variable 'out'"""":"																																
System.out = new PrintStream(new FileOutputStream(FileDescriptor.out)	 true																																
																																	
............................................................																																	
TLDR: Use this on Java 18:																																	
"-Dfile.encoding=""""UTF-8"""" -Dsun.stdout.encoding=""""UTF-8"""" -Dsun.stderr.encoding=""""UTF-8"""""																																	
																																	
From JEP 400:																																	
																																	
There are three charset-related system properties used internally by the JDK. They remain unspecified and unsupported	 but are documented here for completeness:																																
sun.stdout.encoding and sun.stderr.encoding â€?the names of the charsets used for the standard output stream (System.out) and standard error stream (System.err)	 and in the java.io.Console API. sun.jnu.encoding â€?the name of the charset used by the implementation of java.nio.file when encoding or decoding filename paths																																
																																	
As you can see	" those two system properties """"remain unspecified and unsupported"""". But they solved my problem. Therefore"	 and DO NOT use them in production env. I'm running Eclipse on Windows 10 btw.																															
I think there must be a good way to set the default charset of JVM upon running	" and it is stupid that passing -Dfile.encoding=""""UTF-8"""" does not do that. As you can read in JEP 400:"																																
																																	
"If file.encoding is set to """"UTF-8"""" (i.e."	 java -Dfile.encoding=UTF-8)																																
																																	
"And this is exactly what it is """"NOT"""" doing. Passing Dfile.encoding=""""UTF-8"""" does """"not"""" preserve the behavior of existing command lines! I think this shows that Java 18's implementation of JEP 400 is not doing what it should actually be doing"	 which is the root of your problem in the first place.																																
............................................................																																	
Had such trouble as well. Changing setting (File > Settings... > Editor > General > Console) into UTF-32 helped to solve this issue.

I've created a TypeScript library. It has an src directory with .ts files and dist/esm directory	 where all .ts file are converted into .js	 it has typings but there are some problems with the development process.

You can also make them nested if needed (I personally have no need for this though; and never even tried more than one level deep).																																	
HINT: you can use dashes or similar symbols to make it a bit more visible/standing out (distinguish from the actual styles):

NOTES:																																	
																																	
region...endregion style of comment will also work. It is simpler to write & read (since it's not a XML-like tag).																																	
Cons: you cannot provide the default state (collapsed or expanded) this way.																																	
//region My First Block																																	
.main-container .main-wrapper {

You cannot mix multiple comment styles in the same file.

I'm in VSCode and just made a ton of changes on my branch. I have a rough draft that would be a shame to lose due to to not backing up online. So naturally it would be smart to git add . my changes	 then git push origin myBranch to create a remote backup.																																
But doing so will remove all my file diffs that Visual Studio Code's interface shows me in the sidebar (see picture below). Is there a way I can push to a remote branch but still keep the changes unstaged (or bring them back to unstaged)	 or any way to at least keep those diff files so I can still continue work on my local and easily be able to see everywhere that I touched?																																
																																	
",https://stackoverflow.com/questions/72149268/git-commit-and-push-local-changes-without-losing-file-diffs,"																																	
You make a commit and push it to make the remote backup.																																	
Then you discard the commit locally with																																	
git reset HEAD~																																	
																																	
This points your branch to the previous commit and leaves all changes in the files so that you can see the diffs.																																	
Be aware that you will have to force-push your branch later on when you have finished your local commits. That may or may not be a problem depending on how your remote repository is set up.

Settings/Preferences | Plugins -- make sure that CSS plugin is enabled. If not -- enable and restart the IDE.																																	
																																	
																																	
"If still the same: Settings/Preferences | Editor | File Types -- locate """"Cascading style sheet"""" entry and make sure that it has *.css pattern there."																																	
"If not there -- it's possible that you have somehow reassigned it to """"Text"""" file type. If it's there -- just add *.css to Cascading style sheet patterns (it will remove it from Text when doing that)."																																	
																																	
																																	
																																	
If still nothing: you would need to provide more/new screenshots.

I downgraded from Windows 11 to Windows 10 today and had to reinstall the Eclipse-IDE.

Yes	 the warning for projects with no explicit default encoding is a new thing in Eclipse 2022-06 (4.24).																																
To set an explicit default encoding do one of the following:

Consider the bash script below. The script argparse_test.py is an argparse script with various variables.																																	
python -u argparse_test.py \																																	
--is_training 3 \																																	
--root_path ./dataset/ \																																	
#NAME?																																	
-/test_$seq_len'_'196.log 																																	
																																	
How would I convert this bash script to a python script so that I could run it in a python IDE with the various variables?																																	
",https://stackoverflow.com/questions/72676481/converting-an-argparse-bash-script-into-a-python-script,"																																	
This bash input																																	
python -u argparse_test.py \																																	
--is_training 3 \																																	
--root_path ./dataset/ \																																	
#NAME?																																	
-/test_$seq_len'_'196.log 																																	
																																	
should produce a sys.argv that looks like																																	
['argparse_test.py'	 '--is_training'	 '--root_path ./dataset/'	'--data_path'	 'data.csv'	 '-/test_$seq_len'_'196.log'] 																												
																																	
that's a rough guess; bash may be handling the slashes different (I'm on a windows machine now).																																	
"running in an IDE"""" is a vague request."																																	
Some IDE have a run menu item	 and a way of specifying commandline arguments (usually in a separate menu setup item).																																
If you have code that setups up a parser:																																	
parser = argparse.ArgumentParser(...)																																	
...																																	
																																	
the line																																	
args = parser.parse_args()																																	
																																	
reads that sys.argv[1:] and parses it.So an alternative way to use the parser is to provide the equivalent list of strings directly:																																	
argv = ['--is_training'	'3'																																
args = parser.parse_args(argv)																																	
																																	
If you can modify the script	 you could add a couple of displays																																
import sys																																	
print(sys.argv)																																	
																																	
and after the parse_args																																	
print(args)																																	
																																	
args will be a argparse.Namespace object that should display like																																	
Namespace(is_training=3	 root_path='./dataset/'	 ...)																															
																																	
vars(args)																																	
																																	
is a dict with the same keys and values																																	
Any python object with the same attributes should be have the same as args in the rest of your code.																																	
I have a feeling this answer is too long and detailed - because of the vagueness of the question.

Several days ago	 when I started to learn OpenCL	 which provides some basic functions like syntax highlighting and static analysis. I was surprised to find out that Qt Creator is able to do the job.																															
Everything was fine until today I started to use some feature in OpenCL 2.0:																																	
																																	
It looks like Qt Creator use libclang to do the parsing and libclang treats my source files as OpenCL 1.0. But My machine supports OpenCL 3.0 and the code was ok to compile and run. So I doubt it only supports OpenCL 1.0.																																	
My questions are:																																	
																																	
How to make Qt Creator (or the libclang plugin in it) support OpenCL 2.0?																																	
How do you guys write OpenCL 2.0? Is there any better IDEs or editors?																																	
																																	
Thank you guys	 I am really a newbie here.

QtCreator uses KDE syntax highlighting engine. The definitions are simple XML files. You can find them here	 but opencl.xml doesn't look updated for 2.0/3.0 language. You can try to change it																																
In QtCreator	 you can download newer definitions by going to Tools -> Options	" then """"Generic highlighter"""" tab. This will put the updated files in $HOME.local/share/org.kde.syntax-highlighting/"

In Visual Studio	 C#																																
The other shortcuts Ctrl + Left Click or F12 will go to the function's definition in the interface. Which is not so used compared to the necessity to see the actual implementation and navigate code.

First	 what is the best IDE for both spring and JakartaEE?																																
Neither of these really require you to use a specific IDE so you can try out IntelliJ	 VSCode																																
Eclipse has ton of plugins for pretty much everything java	 but this comes at the cost of speed and stability along with complex albeit very configurable user interface. IntelliJ feels like Visual Studio but for Java with its more modern user interface																																
VSCode is great option if you're looking for something lighter and prefer doing things from command line or by fiddling with json	 xml files. It's also great if you need to work with other languages. It's Java extensions are great but at the time of writing still a bit work in progress.																																
best book and the best course for spring and JEE?																																	
Probably best to focus on learning Spring and Spring Boot. This will make it easier to understand which parts of the Jakarta-EE are actually beneficial to learn.																																	
"I've liked the """"in action"""" books from Manning Publications so might try out one of those. They've previews available for many of their books. So maybe check out most recent editions of Spring in Action and Spring boot in action. But like most books they might be a version or two behind but it's generally easier to catch up with the new version if you already know how to use the previous version."																																	
For course you could check out Chad Darby's Spring & Hibernate for Beginners (includes Spring Boot) in Udemy. Haven't encountered many courses for Java-EE but there's Java Enterprise Edition 8 for Beginners course by Luqman Saeed but it's strictly focused on using Java-EE with application servers.

When I assign my color to a control	 that color value is saved with its color name in the .dfm file.																																
But	 when I run my program																																
																																	
Error reading Form1.Color: invalid property value																																	
																																	
I have added a call to register my own color conversion functions in the initialization section of my TSColor unit	 but I don't get any debugger dots for those lines.																																
It works	 if I add the call from the initialization section of the current project's source (.dpr)																																
I could add the initialization call to the project source of each project	 but I would prefer that this call is made automatically as soon as I use TSColors in any of my project's units.																																
What controls whether or not the initialization section of a unit is compiled/executed?																																	
Here are some excerpts of my `TSColors.pas unit:																																	
My self-defined colors:																																	
const																																	
TSColorCount = 4;																																	
clTSRed = TColor($005652EE); //5657327																																	
clTSYellow = TColor($0080FFFE); //8454143																																	
clTSGreen = TColor($004BF562); //4978017																																	
clTSGray = TColor($00BCBCBD); //12369084																																	
TSColorMap: array[0..TSColorCount - 1] of TIdentMapEntry = (																																	
(Value: clTSRed; Name: 'clTSRed')																																	
(Value: clTSYellow; Name: 'clTSYellow')																																	
(Value: clTSGreen; Name: 'clTSGreen')																																	
(Value: clTSGray; Name: 'clTSGray')																																	
 )																																	
																																	
I have my own corresponding functions to convert color names to color values and vice versa:																																	
function TSColorToIdent(Color: Longint; var Ident: string): Boolean;																																	
var																																	
I: Integer;																																	
begin																																	
for I := Low(TSColorMap) to High(TSColorMap) do																																	
if TSColorMap[I].Value = Color then																																	
begin																																	
Result := True;																																	
Ident := TSColorMap[I].Name;																																	
Exit;																																	
end;																																	
Result := ColorToIdent(Color	 Ident); //No Color found. Do the original conversion.																																
end;																																	
																																	
function TSIdentToColor(const Ident: string; var Color: Longint): Boolean;																																	
var																																	
I: Integer;																																	
begin																																	
Result := IdentToColor(Ident	 Color);//first call Delphi original.																																
if not Result then //if Ident is no known Delphi color name	 check my list.																																
for I := Low(TSColorMap) to High(TSColorMap) do 																																	
if SameText(TSColorMap[I].Name	 Ident) then																																
begin																																	
Result := True;																																	
Color := TSColorMap[I].Value;																																	
Exit;																																	
end;																																	
end;																																	
																																	
I have functions to register my own color conversions and to reset to Delphi's original:																																	
procedure UnregisterCurrentColorConst;																																	
var																																	
Int2ID: TIntToIdent;																																	
ID2Int: TIdentToInt;																																	
begin																																	
Int2ID := FindIntToIdent(TypeInfo(TColor));																																	
ID2Int := FindIdentToInt(TypeInfo(TColor));																																	
if Assigned(Int2ID) then																																	
UnregisterIntegerConsts(TypeInfo(TColor)	 ID2Int																																
end;																																	
																																	
procedure RegisterTSColorIdent;																																	
begin																																	
UnregisterCurrentColorConst;

end;																																	
																																	
procedure UnregisterTSColorIdent;																																	
begin																																	
UnregisterCurrentColorConst;																																	
RegisterIntegerConsts(TypeInfo(TColor)	 IdentToColor																																
end;

As you noted in comments	 your unit's initialization section was after the end. of the unit																																
I just want to point out that there are some other issues with your code:																																	
																																	
There is no guarantee that the VCL's ColorToIdent()/IdentToColor() functions are the ones your registration is replacing.There could be other packages installed that register their own color conversion functions. So	 when registering your functions	 and then you can use them inside your functions as fallbacks for values that don't exist in your array.																															
																																	
you don't need to unregister the current registered conversion functions for TColor. The RTL's integer conversion system allows multiple pairs of functions to be registered for the same type.The last registered pair will be the active pair used by the RTL at runtime.So simply unregister your own functions to restore the priority of the previous function pair.																																	
																																	
you can use the RTL's IdentToInt() /IntToIdent() functions to simplify your conversion functions.																																	
																																	
																																	
With that said	 try something more like this:																																
unit TSColors;																																	
																																	
interface																																	
																																	
uses																																	
Vcl.Graphics;																																	
																																	
const																																	
clTSRed = TColor($005652EE); //5657327

The problem is with version of JDK you are using. The Intellij version 2020.2 supports only uptoJDK 14. So either you have to lower the JDK version to 14 or update the IntelliJ to a newer version like 2021.

How can I recover a file that was deleted outside an editor such as VS Code or PyCharm	 if it wasn't committed to Git?																																
",https://stackoverflow.com/questions/72657785/restore-a-deleted-file-using-editor-not-saved-in-git,"																																	
Limitations of Git and backups																																	
Using Git is strongly recommended	 but it's easy to not commit frequently																																
Automated backups are good	 with the same problem of frequency.																																
Editors and IDEs																																	
Some editors or IDEs have automatic local file history features that track every save and work well to recover deleted files	 including:																																
																																	
PyCharm: find the deleted file in the Project pane then use the local history feature to restore the file - details in this guide																																	
																																	
Always test this works in your environment	 sincesome tools only work in limited scenarios.																																
Editors/IDEs with some limitations:																																	
																																	
VS Code has a local file history feature in the Timeline view since March 2022	 but this may not always work to restore a deleted file:																																
																																	
If the deleted file is still open in a tab in VS Code	 it can be restored																																
Opening the deleted file again with code deleted-file.py didn't show any history	 so the file could not be restored

For now	 the functionality that scans and verifies the usage of Spring properties is not fully implemented. For now	 it will suppress all Spring settings (application*.properties and bootstrap*.properties files)	 to give a little more comfort to the eyes	 and that there aren't too many unused warnings. As soon as possible	 I will be happy to make the full version available with the appropriate alerts for unused and deprecated properties.

I am creating an online IDE for different languages. So my approach to the same is to spin up a docker container from my DJango app once a user runs his code	 but the problem is how do I expose the terminal of the docker container to the internet and make it accessible via the browser? I am planning to use xterm.js for the frontend of the terminal but am unable to connect to it.																																
Any form of insight is appreciable.																																	
",https://stackoverflow.com/questions/71648044/how-to-expose-docker-terminal-to-the-internet,"																																	
You can you an reverse-proxy with NGINX to point to your localIP:<container_port>	 and then modify with your domain name.																																
As this exemple below:																																	
location /some/path/ {																																	
proxy_pass http://www.example.com/link/;																																	
}																																	
																																	
Adding some links to help you.																																	
enter link description here																																	
Also you can use 'Nginx Proxy Manager'																																	
............................................................																																	
Short answer:																																	
Your application uses a port to access it (for example	 you use 127.0.0.1:8080 or 192.168.1.100:3000).																																
127.0.0.1 means the computer you are using right now	 192.168.1.100 is a computer inside the 192.168.1.0 network. (Your LAN)																																
You must create (on your router) access from the internet to your application.																																	
For exemple	 if your public IP address is 123.245.123.245	 and map it to your internal address and port (ex: 192.168.1.100:3000)																															
the URL 123.245.123.245:80 will redirect to the website on 192.168.1.100:3000.																																	
On the short term	 this is the easiest solution.																																
For the long term	 you should try using a Reverse Proxy.																																
It's a program that will (depending on the domain) redirect to sites inside your network and adding encryption in the requests (if possible).

The program listed is about writing the Fibonacci series given user input that is below 100. The problem that I am having is figuring out how to get the Fibonacci to not print if the number listed by the user is above 100. However	 I am unable to figure out what to do. This is my code	 it still gives me the Fibonacci series.

Scanner console = new Scanner(System.in);

if(num<100) {																																	
"System.out.println(""""Fibonacci Series till """" + num + """" terms:"""");"																																	
}																																	
int n = 100	 firstTerm = 0																																
for (int i = 1; i <= n; ++i) {																																	
"System.out.print(firstTerm + """""	" """");"																																
																																	
// compute the next term

firstTerm = secondTerm;

The Output that im getting when i print 101	 is																																
																																	
I've used an if/else statement	 but for some reason	 but its still printing above 100. I am unsure how to go about this. Any help is very much appreciated!																															
",https://stackoverflow.com/questions/71641162/printing-fibonacci-series-between-1-99,"																																	
To fix this issue	 you can add another condition into your while loop. Right now	 numbers above 100 are being considered as well. To fix this	 you can make your while loop start like this: while(num>1 && num<=100).																														
............................................................																																	
"Your while check """"while(n>1)"""" will run infinitely. You need to change num's value after every iteration like this:"																																	
num--; //In the loop																																	
																																	
And when num becomes less than 1	 the program exits from the loop.																																
If you want to check whether num is less than 100 or bigger than 1 use if statement(to check if input value corresponds to your range)																																	
while(num > 1 && num < 100){																																	
//your code in while loop																																	
}else{																																	
"System.out.println(""""Your value is too big or too small!"""");"																																	
}																																	
																																	
And also I've noticed your output of fibonacci sequence is not right(negative values	 bound in int32). You can't even display in long values because fibonacci of 9*th order are over quadrillions. Try to use BigInteger in order to show right values in the console output. Want to fancy your output? Use /t and %n in System.out.print();

The question I have is more to see if I'm able to save 25GB of hard drive space. I currently have 2022 Version of Visual Studio Community installed	 though the engine I'm working in requires 2019 to be installed. how ever I have all the same required packages installed in 2022 version. (the engine for some reason does not want to use the newest version of VSC and is trying to force me to revert back) so if I install the previous version will the workloads installed with VSC 2022 be used in VSC 2019 or must I install the work loads independently of each VSC edition in order for me to use it properly ? If they are able to use the same workloads am i required to connect them in some way? if they are not able to read the same workloads

"Visual Studio's installation is authored with two types of packages: """"standalone"""" or shared packages"	 which are typically independent MSIs that are installed in a shared folder																																
The former group is basically what you're asking for.However	 different versions of VS may install different versions of those shared packages (e.g. VS2022 may have a newer version of a standalone component than what VS2019 shipped with	 it will be shared.																															
The latter group is not shared	 usually because they are tightly coupled to other Visual Studio components and attempting to re-use them across arbitrary versions of VS could lead to weird runtime behaviors.																																
So	 to a large extent	 as much as it can (according to the people that create each component).

Bracket Pair Colorizer is no longer maintained. It's outdated.																																	
Instead	 you can colorize your brackets by adding this single line to your settings.json:																																
"editor.bracketPairColorization.enabled"""": true"																																	
																																	
............................................................																																	
If you are facing trouble activating the default bracket pair colorizer then here are the steps to follow. In VS Code	 Ctrl + Shift + P > type json in search box > click on Open User Settings(JSON). In settings.json file																																
Now just write below 2 lines anywhere after putting a comma at the end of the line before them :																																	
"editor.bracketPairColorization.enabled"""": true"																																	
"editor.guides.bracketPairs"""": true"																																	
............................................................																																	
																																	
																																	
Bracket pair colorizer functionality is now built into VS Code. So don't even install that extension.																																	
																																	
																																	
																																	
																																	
2.Even if you add the below line in settings.json file																																	
{ 																																	
"editor.bracketPairColorization.enabled"""": true"	 																																
"editor.guides.bracketPairs"""": """"active"""""																																	
}																																	
																																	
																																	
																																	
Doesn't make any difference.																																	
																																	
No need of donation	 and even turning on any setting.																																
																																	
																																	
............................................................																																	
Two properties you need to change in settings.json																																	
{

I often use markers to underline a part of code (e.g.	 to invite users to hover on it and see hints). Most of time	 we may want to underline the position between two characters. For instance	 given a formula fg(23	)	 I want to underline the position between 	 and )	 then hovering on it shows a non-empty argument is expected here.																										
It seems that the following code in the playground can achieve this more or less.																																	
"var ed = monaco.editor.create(document.getElementById(""""container"""")"	 {																																
"value: """"fg(23"	")"""""																																
"language: """"javascript"""""

startColumn: 7																																	
endLineNumber: 1																																	
endColumn: 7

}])																																	
																																	
However	 setting startColumn same as endColumn does not always do the trick. For instance	 endColumn: 4 does not work.																															
So does anyone know how to mark a position between 2 characters? We are not limited to underlining	 other ways like highlighting are welcomed as well.

{																																	
range: new monaco.Range(1	4	 6)

startColumn - the numeric value of the first highlight character																																	
endLineNumber - which line stops the highlight																																	
endColumn - the numeric value of last highlighted character

Summary																																	
My dead simple Excel workbook myTestBook.xlsb has a single empty table and a single code module with the routine test_openclose() inside. This routine just opens another Excel workbook (Mappe3.xlsx)	 then closes that workbook again.																																
When the routine is run (Alt-F8) with the VBA IDE closed	 everything is fine.																																
When the routine is run (Alt-F8) with the VBA IDE opened	 the intermittently opened workbooks keep getting listed in the IDE's project explorer. Each repetitive run leads to another entry in the IDE's project explorer.																																
Why is that and what can I do against this effect?																																	
View after 6 runs with closed IDE (no entries) and 3 runs with IDE open (3 entries):

There is more settings profiles support in v1.71	 see v1.71 Release Notes: Settings Profiles																																
																																	
In this milestone	 we added CLI support for Settings Profiles feature.																																
You can now pass the name of the profile using --profile arg and open																																	
a folder or a workspace using that profile. Following instruction																																	
opens the web-sample folder with the Web Development profile. If the																																	
profile does not exist	 a new empty profile with the given name is																																
created.																																	
"code ~/projects/web-sample --profile """"Web Development"""""																																	
We also added support for Temporary Settings Profile that can be																																	
created and associated to a folder or workspace temporarily. This																																	
profile gets auto deleted once it is not associated to any folder or																																	
workspace.																																	
																																	
																																	
"Expanded support for """"profiles"""" will be in a preview state in vscode v1.69.From release notes: settings profiles:"																																	
																																	
A Settings Profile comprises of settings	 keyboard shortcuts																																
extensions	 state	 and snippets. You can customize VS Code for																															
different development environments like Web	 Machine Learning																																
multiple programming language classrooms like Python	 Java or for																																
personal modes like Work or Demo and save them as Settings Profiles.																																	
You can open multiple workspaces (folders) with different profiles																																	
simultaneously based on the projects you are working on or the																																	
classroom you are attending to or when you are presenting.																																	
Below demonstrates customizing VS Code for web development environment																																	
and creating a settings profile out of it.																																	
																																	
																																	
[more gifs from the release notes omitted here]																																	
																																	
You can open your React project in web development profile and Python																																	
class project in Python class profile simultaneously as shown in the																																	
following picture.																																	
																																	
																																	
"workbench.colorCustomizations"""": {"																																	
"statusBarItem.settingsProfilesBackground"""": """"#ce4918"""""																																	
"statusBarItem.settingsProfilesForeground"""": """"#e0dfdb"""""																																	
}																																	
																																	
																																	
You can manage and remove settings profiles using the Remove Settings Profile... action available in the Settings Profiles sub menu in																																	
Settings gear menu.																																	
Even though you can customize VS Code per profile	 there are some																																
which can be customized only at application level. For example	 all																																
application scoped settings like update.mode	 language pack																																
extensions	 settings sync enablement and workspace trust state shall																																
be customized across all profiles at application level.																																	
																																	
............................................................																																	
You can create a .vscode folder in each and every project you build																																	
and add your customized setting.json for every project																																	
reference https://code.visualstudio.com/docs/getstarted/settings

I am trying something like this:																																	
																																	
1) Binding Any-KeyPress event to a function that returns the line on which the keypress occurs:																																	
																																	
"textPad.bind(""""<Any-KeyPress>"""""	 linenumber)

 for i in range(0	 len(line)):																																
linelabel= Label(lnbar	 text=i)																																
linelabel.pack(side=LEFT)																																	
lnbar.pack(expand=NO	 fill=X																																
																																	
																																	
Unfortunately this is giving some weird numbers on the frame.																																	
Is there a simpler solution?																																	
How to approach this?																																	
",https://stackoverflow.com/questions/16369470/tkinter-adding-line-number-to-text-widget,"																																	
I have a relatively foolproof solution	 but it's complex and will likely be hard to understand because it requires some knowledge of how Tkinter and the underlying tcl/tk text widget works. I'll present it here as a complete solution that you can use as-is because I think it illustrates a unique approach that works quite well.																																
Note that this solution works no matter what font you use	 and whether or not you use different fonts on different lines	 and so on.																															
Importing Tkinter																																	
Before we get started	 the following code assumes tkinter is imported like this if you're using python 3.0 or greater:																																
import tkinter as tk																																	
																																	
... or this	 for python 2.x:																																
import Tkinter as tk																																	
																																	
The line number widget																																	
Let's tackle the display of the line numbers. What we want to do is use a canvas so that we can position the numbers precisely. We'll create a custom class	 and give it a new method named redraw that will redraw the line numbers for an associated text widget. We also give it a method attach																																
This method takes advantage of the fact that the text widget itself can tell us exactly where a line of text starts and ends via the dlineinfo method. This can tell us precisely where to draw the line numbers on our canvas. It also takes advantage of the fact that dlineinfo returns None if a line is not visible	 which we can use to know when to stop displaying line numbers.																																
class TextLineNumbers(tk.Canvas):																																	
def __init__(self	 *args																																
tk.Canvas.__init__(self	 *args																																
self.textwidget = None																																	
																																	
def attach(self	 text_widget):																																
self.textwidget = text_widget																																	
																																	
def redraw(self	 *args):																																
'''redraw line numbers'''																																	
"self.delete(""""all"""")"																																	
																																	
"i = self.textwidget.index(""""@0"	"0"""")"																																
while True :																																	
dline= self.textwidget.dlineinfo(i)																																	
if dline is None: break																																	
y = dline[1]																																	
"linenum = str(i).split(""""."""")[0]"																																	
self.create_text(2	y	 text=linenum)																															
"i = self.textwidget.index(""""%s+1line"""" % i)"																																	
																																	
If you associate this with a text widget and then call the redraw method	 it should display the line numbers just fine.																																
Automatically updating the line numbers																																	
This works	 but has a fatal flaw: you have to know when to call redraw. You could create a binding that fires on every key press	 and you have to handle the case where a user presses a key and uses the auto-repeat function	 etc. The line numbers also need to be redrawn if the window is grown or shrunk or the user scrolls	 so we fall into a rabbit hole of trying to figure out every possible event that could cause the numbers to change.																													
There is another solution	 which is to have the text widget fire an event whenever something changes. Unfortunately	 we can use a proxy to intercept changes to the text widget and generate an event for us.																															
"In an answer to the question """"https://stackoverflow.com/q/13835207/7432"""" I offered a similar solution that shows how to have a text widget call a callback whenever something changes. This time"	 instead of a callback we'll generate an event since our needs are a little different.																																
A custom text class																																	
Here is a class that creates a custom text widget that will generate a <<Change>> event whenever text is inserted or deleted	 or when the view is scrolled.

............................................................																																	
Here's my attempt at doing the same thing. I tried Bryan Oakley's answer above	 it looks and works great	 it takes a long time to do that. In order to work around this	 I used a normal Text widget to draw the line numbers	 here's how I did it:																													
																																	
Create the Text widget and grid it to the left of the main text widget that you're adding the lines for	 let's call it textarea. Make sure you also use the same font you use for textarea:																																
																																	
self.linenumbers = Text(self	 width=3)																																
self.linenumbers.grid(row=__textrow	 column=__linenumberscol																																
self.linenumbers.config(font=self.__myfont)																																	
																																	
																																	
Add a tag to right-justify all lines added to the line numbers widget	 let's call it line:																																
																																	
self.linenumbers.tag_configure('line'	 justify='right')																																
																																	
																																	
Disable the widget so that it cannot be edited by the user																																	
																																	
self.linenumbers.config(state=DISABLED)																																	
																																	
																																	
Now the tricky part is adding one scrollbar	 let's call it uniscrollbar to control both the main text widget as well as the line numbers text widget. In order to do that	 one to be called by the scrollbar	 which can then update the two text widgets to reflect the new position	 and the other to be called whenever a text area is scrolled	 which will update the scrollbar:																												
																																	
def __scrollBoth(self	 action	 type=None):																															
self.textarea.yview_moveto(position)																																	
self.linenumbers.yview_moveto(position)																																	
																																	
def __updateScroll(self	 first	 type=None):																															
self.textarea.yview_moveto(first)																																	
self.linenumbers.yview_moveto(first)																																	
self.uniscrollbar.set(first	 last)																																
																																	
																																	
Now we're ready to create the uniscrollbar:																																	
																																	
self.uniscrollbar= Scrollbar(self)																																	
self.uniscrollbar.grid(row=self.__uniscrollbarRow	 column=self.__uniscrollbarCol																																
self.uniscrollbar.config(command=self.__scrollBoth)																																	
self.textarea.config(yscrollcommand=self.__updateScroll)																																	
self.linenumbers.config(yscrollcommand=self.__updateScroll)																																	
																																	
																																	
Voila! You now have a very lightweight text widget with line numbers:																																	
																																	
																																	
............................................................																																	
																																	
I have seen an example on a site called unpythonic but its assumes that line height of txt is 6 pixels.																																	
																																	
																																	
Compare:																																	
																																	
																																	
# assume each line is at least 6 pixels high																																	
step = 6																																	
																																	
																																	
step - how often (in pixels) program check text widget for new lines. If height of line in text widget is 30 pixels	 this program performs 5 checks and draw only one number.																																
You can set it to value that <6 if font is very small.																																	
There is one condition: all symbols in text widget must use one font	 and widget that draw numbers must use the same font.																																
																																	
# http://tkinter.unpythonic.net/wiki/A_Text_Widget_with_Line_Numbers																																	
class EditorClass(object):																																	
...																																	
																																	
																																	
self.lnText = Text(self.frame																																	
...																																	
state='disabled'	 font=('times'																																
self.lnText.pack(side=LEFT	 fill='y')																																
# The Main Text Widget																																	
self.text = Text(self.frame																																	
bd=0																																	
padx = 4	 font=('times'																																
...																																	
																																	
............................................................																																	
After thoroughly reading through each solution mentioned here	 and trying some of them out myself	 but should be enough for someone who is looking for a quick and easy to implement method	 which is also simple in principle.																														
																																	
It draws the line's in the same manner	 but instead of generating <<Change>> events	 scroll	 left click events to the text as well as left click event to the scrollbar. In order to not glitch when	 e.g. a paste command is performed	 it then waits 2ms before actually redrawing the line numbers.																												
																																	
EDIT: This is also similair to FoxDot's solution	 but instead of constantly refreshing the line numbers

What is the meaning of the following control characters: 																																	
																																	
																																	
Carriage return																																	
Line feed																																	
Form feed																																	
																																	
",https://stackoverflow.com/questions/3091524/what-are-carriage-return-linefeed-and-form-feed,"																																	
Carriage return means to return to the beginning of the current line without advancing downward.The name comes from a printer's carriage	" as monitors were rare when the name was coined.This is commonly escaped as """"\r"""""	 and has ASCII value 13 or 0xD.																															
Linefeed means to advance downward to the next line; however	" it has been repurposed and renamed.Used as """"newline"""""	 abbreviated LF or NL	" and has ASCII value 10 or 0xA. CRLF (but not CRNL) is used for the pair """"\r\n""""."																														
"Form feed means advance downward to the next """"page"""".It was commonly used as page separators"	" but now is also used as section separators.Text editors can use this character when you """"insert a page break"""".This is commonly escaped as """"\f"""""	 and has ASCII value 12 or 0xC.																															
																																	
As control characters	 they may be interpreted in various ways.																																
The most important interpretation is how these characters delimit lines.Lines end with NL on Unix (including OS X)	 CRLF on Windows	 for the exact same character	 gives the differences between Windows and Unix	 which is also why many Windows programs use CRLF to separate instead of terminate lines.Many text editors can read files in any of these three formats and convert between them	 but not all utilities can.																												
Form feed is much less commonly used.As page separator	 it can only come between lines or at the start or end of the file.																																
............................................................																																	
\r is carriage return and moves the cursor back like if i will do-																																	
																																	
"printf(""""stackoverflow\rnine"""")"																																	
ninekoverflow																																	
																																	
																																	
"means it has shifted the cursor to the beginning of """"stackoverflow"""" and overwrites the starting four characters since """"nine"""" is four character long."																																	
																																	
\n is new line character which changes the line and takes the cursor to the beginning of a new line like-																																	
																																	
"printf(""""stackoverflow\nnine"""")"																																	
stackoverflow																																	
nine																																	
																																	
																																	
\f is form feed	 its use has become obsolete but it is used for giving indentation like																																
																																	
"printf(""""stackoverflow\fnine"""")"																																	
stackoverflow																																	
 nine																																	
																																	
																																	
if i will write like-																																	
																																	
"printf(""""stackoverflow\fnine\fgreat"""")"

............................................................																																	
In short:																																	
																																	
Carriage return (\r or 0xD): To take control at starting on the same line.																																	
Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Line feed (\n or 0xA): To Take control at starting on the next line.																																	
Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Form feed (\f or 0xC): To take control at starting on the next page.																																	
																																	
																																	
More details and more control characters can be found on the following page: Control character																																	
............................................................																																	
Have a look at Wikipedia:																																	
																																	
																																	
Systems based on ASCII or a compatible character set use either LF (Line feed	 '\n'	 10 in decimal) or CR (Carriage return	 '\r'	 0x0D	 13 in decimal) individually	 or CR followed by LF (CR+LF	 0x0D 0x0A). These characters are based on printer commands: The line feed indicated that one line of paper should feed out of the printer	 and a carriage return indicated that the printer carriage should return to the beginning of the current line.																									
																																	
............................................................																																	
\f is used for page break.																																	
You cannot see any effect in the console. But when you use this character constant in your file then you can see the difference.																																	
																																	
Other example is that if you can redirect your output to a file then you don't have to write a file or use file handling.																																	
																																	
For ex:																																	
																																	
Write this code in c++																																	
																																	
void main()																																	
{																																	
clrscr();																																	
"cout<<""""helloooooo"""" ;"																																	
																																	
"cout<<""""\f"""";"																																	
"cout<<""""hiiiii"""" ;"																																	
																																	
}																																	
																																	
																																	
and when you compile this it generatean exe(for ex. abc.exe)																																	
																																	
then you can redirect your output to a file using this:																																	
																																	
abc > xyz.doc																																	
																																	
then open the file xyz.doc you can see the actual page break between hellooo and hiiii....																																	
............................................................																																	
On old paper-printer terminals	 advancing to the next line involved two actions: moving the print head back to the beginning of the horizontal scan range (carriage return) and advancing the roll of paper being printed on (line feed).																																
																																	
Since we no longer use paper-printer terminals	 those actions aren't really relevant anymore																																
............................................................																																	
Apart from above information	 there is still an interesting history of LF (\n) and CR (\r).																																
[Original author : é˜®ä¸€å³?Source : http://www.ruanyifeng.com/blog/2006/04/post_213.html]																																	
																																	
Before computer came out	 there was a type of teleprinter called Teletype Model 33. It can print 10 characters each second. But there is one problem with this	 it will take 0.2 second to move to next line	 which is time of printing 2 characters. If a new characters is transferred during this 0.2 second	 then this new character will be lost.																													
																																	
So scientists found a way to solve this problem	 they add two ending characters after each line	 which is to tell the printer to bring the print head to the left.; the other one is 'Line feed'	 it tells the printer to move the paper up 1 line.																														
																																	
Later	 computer became popular	 the storage device was very expensive	 so some scientists said that it was expensive to add two characters at the end of each line	 one is enough	 so there are some arguments about which one to use.																												
																																	
In UNIX/Mac and Linux	 '\n' is put at the end of each line	 '\r\n' is put at the end of each line. The consequence of this use is that files in UNIX/Mac will be displayed in one line if opened in Windows. While file in Windows will have one^M at the end of each line if opened in UNIX or Mac.																															
............................................................																																	
Consider an IBM 1403 impact printer. CR moved the print head to the start of the line	" but did NOT advance the paper. This allowed for """"overprinting"""""	 as was BOLD print. LF advanced the paper one line. If there was no CR	 the next line would print as a staggered-step because LF didn't move the print head. FF advanced the paper to the next page. It typically also moved the print head to the start of the first line on the new page	 but you might need CR for that. To be sure	 most programmers coded CRFF instead of CRLF at the end of the last line on a page because an extra CR created by FF wouldn't matter.																												
............................................................																																	
As a supplement																																	
																																	
1	 Carriage return:It's a printer terminology meaning changing the print location to the beginning of current line. In computer world																																
																																	
2	 Line feed:It's a printer terminology meaning advancing the paper one line. So Carriage return and Line feed are used together to start to print at the beginning of a new line. In computer world																																
																																	
3	 Form feed: It's a printer terminology																																
																																	
																																	
If you were programming for a 1980s-style printer	 it would eject the																																
paper and start a new page. You are virtually certain to never need																																	
it.																																	
																																	
http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Form_feed																																	
																																	
																																	
It's almost obsolete and you can refer to Escape sequence \f - form feed - what exactly is it? for detailed explanation.																																	
																																	
Note	 we can use CR or LF or CRLF to stand for newline in some platforms but newline can't be stood by them in some other platforms. Refer to wiki Newline for details.

"\n"""" is the linefeed character.It means end the present line and go to a new line for anyone who is reading it."																																	
............................................................																																	
Carriage return and line feed are also references to typewriters	 in that the with a small push on the handle on the left side of the carriage (the place where the paper goes)	 advancing the document one line. If you had finished typing one line	 and wanted to continue on to the next	 you pushed harder	 both advancing a line and sliding the carriage all the way to the right	 then resuming typing left to right again as the carriage traveled with each keystroke. Needless to say	 word-wrap was the default setting for all word processing of the era. P:D																										
............................................................																																	
Those are non-printing characters	" relating to the concept of """"new line"""". \n is linefeed. \r is carriage return. On different platforms they have different meanings"	 a new line is \r\n. In linux	 \n. In mac	 \r.																													
																																	
In practice	 you put them in any string

when I was an apprentice in the Royal Signals many (50) years ago	" teletypes and typewriters had """"Carriage"""" with the printing head on them. When you pressed RETURN the Carriage would fly to the left. Hence Carriage Return (CR). You could just return the Carriage"	 you'd use the Lever (much like a tremolo lever on an electric guitar) which would also do the Line Feed. Your next question is why would you not want the line feed?heh heh well in those days to delete characters we'd do a CR then use a Tip-ex-like paper in between the hammerheads and paper and type the same keys to over-write with white ink. Some fancy typewriters had a key you could press. So there you go.

I'm trying to achieve good developer experience for my TypeScript API	 but I'm facing unexpected issue.																																
When overloading function like shown below:																																	
/** Comment 1 */																																	
function a(key: 'key1'	 args: { arg1: number }): string																																
/** Comment 2 */																																	
function a(key: 'key2'	 args: { arg2: number }): string																																
function a(key: string	 args) { }																																
																																	
When someone is trying to call that function in an IDE (I tried VSCode and WebStorm)																																	
a('key2'	 { })																																
// ^																																	
																																	
the IDE suggests object property based on union of second type. (in this case arg1 and arg2)																																	
I would like It to behave similar to this code:

function a(key: 'key1'): (args: { arg1: number }) => string

function a(key: 'key2'): (args: { arg2: number }) => string																																	
function a(key: string	 args) { }																																
																																	
where when calling																																	
a('key2')({ })																																	
// ^																																	
																																	
only needed properties show up.

This is a common problem - for instance in event listener contexts - and I faced it myself recently. Fortunately	 there is a simple and elegant solution.																																
First of all	 in your question there are two slightly different formulations of the problem; once	 and once it is the singular argument to a function that you want to return from a. The following solution should work for both versions	 but I'll present it for the first scenario	 which should be more common.																													
The main trick is to avoid overloads and replace them by a single generic; that also makes handling a and typing much easier. As far as I can think	 this should always be possible in the cases you describe.																																
Step 1: Define your function signatures/overloads by an interface:																																	
interface Signatures {																																	
key1: {arg1: number};																																	
key2: {arg2: number};																																	
}																																	
																																	
Of course	 that would be a bit more difficult for more than 2 arguments; but scenarios that are typical for the mentioned problem to arise usually have exactly 2 arguments - one key and one value.																																
Step 2: Define a single function generic function signature:																																	
function a<K extends keyof Signatures>(key: K	 args: Signatures[K]): string {																																
return 'hello world'; // TODO																																	
}																																	
																																	
Then	 when you call a('key1'	 args is automatically inferred to be of type {arg1: number}.

const numOfCakes = useSelector((state) => state.cake.numOfCakes)																																	
																																	
Which works if I replaced it with																																	
const numOfCakes = 3																																	
																																	
The code is in the file CakeView.jsx (from the tutorial)																																	
import React from 'react'																																	
import { useSelector } from 'react-redux'																																	
																																	
export const CakeView = () => {																																	
const numOfCakes = useSelector((state) => state.cake.numOfCakes)																																	
return (																																	
<div>																																	
<h2>Number of cakes - { numOfCakes } </h2>																																	
<button>Order cake</button>																																	
<button>Restock cakes</button>																																	
</div>																																	
)																																	
}																																	
																																	
This makes reference to the code in the file 	 also from the same tutorial:																																
import { createSlice } from '@reduxjs/toolkit'																																	
import axios from 'axios'																																	
																																	
const initialState = {																																	
numOfCakes: 10																																	
}																																	
																																	
const cakeSlice = createSlice({																																	
name: 'cake'																																	
initialState																																	
reducers: {																																	
ordered: (state) => {																																	
state.numOfCakes--																																	
}																																	
restocked: (state	 action) => {																																
state.numOfCakes += action.payload																																	
}																																	
}																																	
})																																	
																																	
export default cakeSlice.reducer																																	
export const { ordered	 restocked } = cakeSlice.actions																																
																																	
I'm not sure what I may doing wrong. I've gone over the video tutorials multiple times checking but they seem to be the same. Maybe I'm so caught up in it that I'm missing something obvious. If the problem is not obviously in one of these files	 I'm hoping someone can suggest some sort of extension (I'm using VS Code) that would issue better diagnostics. (The link is of a tutorial that is 27th in a series of 31 videos so it's a bit of stuff to work through although the videos are short and quite well done

You can log from all parts of the code and modify it whenever a variable has an unexpected value.																																	
You can use actionCreators to execute code delays or asynchronous and check the code in different modes. In the same situations as pending or success or error	 and also at the end to get errors from the server

Intellij keeps reordering my imports like so:

Whereas our maven checkstyle wants the order like so:

I should also point out	 that this doesn't apply to all the imports

Using supported JavaFX CSS constructs																																	
I don't think the : in var notation is supported for JavaFX CSS (I don't even know what it is	 to be honest).																																
See the JavaFX CSS reference:																																	
																																	
https://docs.oracle.com/javase/8/javafx/api/javafx/scene/doc-files/cssref.html.																																	
																																	
The likely equivalent for JavaFX is:																																	
																																	
named colors	 looked up colors and color functions																																
																																	
																																	
Named Colors <named-color>																																	
CSS supports a bunch of named constant colors. Named colors can be																																	
specified with just their unquoted name for example:																																	
.button {																																	
-fx-background-color: red; 																																	
}																																	
																																	
Looked-up Colors <looked-up-color>																																	
With looked-up colors you can refer to any other color property that																																	
is set on the current node or any of its parents. This is a very																																	
powerful feature	 as it allows a generic palette of colors to be																																
specified on the scene then used thoughout the application. If you																																	
want to change one of those palette colors you can do so at any level																																	
in the scene tree and it will affect that node and all its decendents.																																	
Looked-up colors are not looked up until they are applied	 so they are																																
live and react to any style changes that might occur	 such as																																
"replacing a palette color at runtime with the """"style"""" property on a"																																	
node.																																	
In the following example	 all background color of all buttons uses the																																
"looked up color """"ABC""""."																																	
.root { abc: #f00 } 																																	
.button { -fx-background-color: abc }																																	
																																	
Color Functions <color-function>																																	
JavaFX supports some color computation functions. These compute new																																	
colors from input colors at the time the color style is applied. This																																	
enables a color theme to be specified using a single base color and to																																	
have variant colors computed from that base color. There are two color																																	
functions: derive() and ladder().																																	
<derive> | <ladder>																																	
Derive 																																	
derive( <color> 	 <number>% )																																
																																	
The derive function takes a color and computes a brighter or darker																																	
version of that color. The second parameter is the brightness offset																																	
representing how much brighter or darker the derived color should be.																																	
Positive percentages indicate brighter colors and negative percentages																																	
indicate darker colors. A value of -100% means completely black	0%																																
means no change in brightness	 and 100% means completely white.																																
Ladder																																	
ladder(<color> 	 <color-stop> [																																
																																	
The ladder function interpolates between colors. The effect is as if a																																	
gradient is created using the stops provided	 and then the brightness																																
of the provided <color> is used to index a color value within that																																	
gradient. At 0% brightness	 the color at the 0.0 end of the gradient																																
is used; at 100% brightness	 the color at the 1.0 end of the gradient																																
is used; and at 50% brightness	 the color at 0.5																																
the gradient	 is used. Note that no gradient is actually rendered.																																
This is merely an interpolation function that results in a single																																	
color.																																	
																																	
I suggest you use these supported and documented features of JavaFX instead.																																	
There are many examples of their use in the modena.css file which can be found inside your JavaFX installation packages (in Idea search for the file modena.css in your project libraries).																																	
On IDE support (specifically IntelliJ Idea)																																	
With regard specifically to the support for displaying colors parsed from CSS in an IDE	 it will of course vary by IDE.																																
For IntelliJ Idea	 which I think you are using																																
As of 2022.1 Ultimate Edition	 for JavaFX CSS																																
It will NOT display colors that are assigned via JavaFX looked-up colors or some of the JavaFX color derivation functions. It will display stops in gradients as long as they are not looked up	 but won't display the gradients themselves.Enhancement requests for the IDE could be raised for the IDE to add color display support for the looked up and derived colors and additional support for displaying gradients.

I want to replicate the VS code feature of 'highlight and comment out code' (usually bound to keys SHIFT + /) in vim.																																	
I can run :g//s/^/\/\/ / in normal mode to prepend // at the start of every line. I just want to put a constraint on this so it only applies the substitution to lines highlighted in visual mode.																																	
",https://stackoverflow.com/questions/72052292/how-to-execute-specific-regex-substitution-on-selected-lines-in-visual-mode-in-v,"																																	
Visually select all the lines (using V)	 then hit :.																																
This will give you :'<	'> which is the range of your visual selection.																																
Then you can add your vim command to it.																																	
I would recommend the following method if you wish to not use plugins.																																	
:'<	'>normal I//																																
																																	
Which is not a substitution.																																	
If you want a really nice vim plugin that does this task in a vim manner	 check out tpope's vim-commentary which is an essential in my opinion.																																
............................................................																																	
																																	
I can run :g//s/^/\/\/ / in normal mode to prepend // at the start of every line.																																	
																																	
Well	 that would be an unnecessarily complicated way to do it and your command wouldn't really work anyway.																																
																																	
:g// either matches nothing or it matches the previous search. What you want	 here																																
																																	
A simple substitution on the whole buffer would be much simpler and much faster:																																	
:%s/^/\/\/ /																																	
																																	
Using :help :global in this context provides no value (you want to operate on every line anyway) and is considerably slower (we are talking thousands of times slower)																																	
																																	
You can use alternative separators to avoid all that backslashing:																																	
:%s@^@// @																																	
																																	
																																	
The last separator is not even needed:																																	
:%s@^@// <-- there is a space	 here																																
																																	
																																	
And the kicker: you can enter command-line mode from visual mode like you would do from normal mode	 by pressing :. So you can simply make your visual selection	 and run your substitution:																															
"v"""" enter visual mode"																																	
"<motion> """" expand the selection"																																	
":"""" press :"																																	
:'<	"'> """" Vim inserts the range covering the visual selection for you"																																
:'<	"'>s@^@// <CR>"""" perform your substitution"

The story: I've learned that it's recommended to define all instance attributes in the __init__() function of a class for better clarity. And I've been following this best practice for a long time until I encounter this problem:																																	
Let's say I have a base class Foo:																																	
class Foo(object):																																	
def __init__(self):																																	
self.a	 self.b																																
self.more_initialization()																																	
																																	
def more_initialization(self):																																	
raise NotImplementedError																																	
																																	
So this base class will not be used directly	 but its subclasses. Each of the subclasses may define its own instance attributes and initialize them in more_initialization()																																
(This is just a very simple case; please refer to chepner's answer for some discussions.)																																	
But my linter (I'm using PyCharm) doesn't seem to be happy with that. It complains every time I assign value to an instance attribute not seen in __init__():																																	
class Bar(Foo):																																	
def more_initialization(self):																																	
self.d = 0# warning: instance attribute defined outside __init__																																	
																																	
def work(self):																																	
self.d = 1# same warning																																	
																																	
The question: I wonder if there's any way to suppress such warnings for this particular case (Foo and all its subclasses)	 such as # noqa that will be identified by most linters. Developers subclassing Foo may not be all using the same IDE																																
Personally I use PyCharm	 and there're two not-so-elegant ways to deal with this:																																
																																	
Mark the function as protected by adding an underscore prefix (_more_initialization())																																	
Set a rule that all subclasses of Foo must be placed in a file named with some pattern	 and use this pattern to define a scope in which the warning is suppressed (also affecting other classes in the same files)																																
																																	
But I'm hoping for a general solution. Is there any?																																	
In fact	 it seems like I've been doing such kind of things for a while in unittest. I always define new instance attributes in setUp() before using them in my test cases

",https://stackoverflow.com/questions/71988393/codeblocks-output-differs-from-online-compilers,"																																	
Problem is with the logic of your code. The good output is the Code::Blocks one.																																	
The problem is within the insertNode function. Its behaviour is the following : it finds the i-1th node and create a new node after it. If i = 0	 the 0th element is found in the first iteration of your first loop and there will be no error after that																																
Furthermore	 each time you call your insertNode function																																
So you will have this :																																	
---------- ----- -----																																	
| random |---> | 1 |---> | 2 |---> etc.																																	
---------- ----- -----																																	
head0th 1st																																	
																																	
After that	 in the listGet function	 when will call listGet(head	0	 &x)	 the condition p->next != NULL && j < i will always be satisfied at the first iteration	 meaning that the returned node is not the 0th	 but the head. You should instead write :																										
j = -1;// 0 become -1																																	
while(p->next != NULL && j < i)																																	
{																																	
p = p->next;																																	
j++;																																	
}																																	
																																	
Moreover	 you must change the bound of your loop in the main. Indeed	 10)	 but the indexation does not begin from 1 bt from 0	 meaning that you must not stop at 10 (because there is no 10th node) but at 9. Therefore you must write :																													
for(i = 0; i < ListLength(head) - 1; i++)																																	
{																																	
if(ListGet(head	 i																																
{																																	
"printf(""""Error! \n"""");"																																	
return 1;																																	
}																																	
"else printf(""""%d"""""	 x);/* show data elements*/																																
}																																	
																																	
There is another point that is not related to this problem but that you must correct anyway : your destroy function.																																	
void Destroy(SLNode **head)																																	
{																																	
SLNode *p	 *p1;																																
																																	
p = *head;																																	
while(p != NULL)																																	
{																																	
p1 = p;																																	
p = p->next;																																	
																																	
/* make NULL assignment here */																																	
p1->next = NULL;																																	
																																	
free(p1);																																	
}																																	
/* head has been already freed in the above loop																																	
*do not try to manipulate it */																																	
// *head = NULL;

Now you can easily notice I am new on app development path when I am setting up Android studio for Android development I find that my pc need specific requirements (Hardware) to start																																	
But I have desktop that																																	
CPU : Core 2Duo																																	
RAM : 4 GB																																	
HDD : 500 GB																																	
It's been week when I just run some basic apps but it's very headache to do it for basics app because my android studio every minute got hang and start lagging I can't open chrome there full of warehouse of my problems related to pc because of android studio																																	
Anyone know any hacks or by tips for me you can feel free for it.																																	
",https://stackoverflow.com/questions/71553838/how-can-i-speed-up-my-pc-for-android-development-ft-android-studio,"																																	
Putting it bluntly: those specs are simply not enough to do any serious modern development. If you could replacing the HDD with an SSD (even a small	 cheap one) would be the highest priority and more memory is second. A better CPU would obviously help	 the other two items are more important.																															
Assuming that's not an option	 you can do either of those two things:																																
																																	
don't use an IDE (or at least a more light-weight one	 such as VS Code) and build your software from the command line. This will be more painful (especially when you're just starting) and even then the resource requirements of the build will be non-trivial.																																
Make sure to do as little as possible on your local machine. If you have a decent internet connection	 then you might be better off developing on a free remote cloud computer and use something like Projector to show the UI in the browser. I've found this repo with instructions on how to use it with Android Studio	 but I've not verified that it works.																															
																																	
............................................................																																	
The only hacks I can think of are:																																	
																																	
"Make sure you are not using a remote mounted file system or """"share"""" for either your Android Studio + Java installation or your AS workspace."																																	
																																	
Shutoff (quit) all other applications that are using significant amounts of RAM; e.g. your web browsers	 your email tool	 Zoom	 etc.																														
																																	
If you are using Windows	 switch to Linux.																																
																																	
																																	
																																	
Better idea: get a better development machine.I think that the RAM is most important	 because it sounds like your machine is thrashing.																																
............................................................																																	
It may seem unfair but Android Studio is not really suitable to run in a lower end device. It used to lag/hang in my device with Core i7 and 8GB Ram. The best thing you can do is to use an SSD instead of HDD. SSDs with smaller memory are often cheap and this alone can somewhat lessen your problems with Android Studio.																																	
............................................................																																	
i think you shouldchange your HDD to 240 GB SSD and it will works fine

This happen when you'alterating state variables defined in view functions.																																	
Thus	 view functions can only reads data from your smart contract.																																
To solve your issue	 I tried to split the content about results() function in two functions. The first function that I called setResults() is a similar to setter functions (in other programming languages)																																
Second function	 allows you to view the result about the comparison between a and b elements.																																
In the following lines	 I put your smart contract adjusted where I inserted some notes:

owner = msg.sender;

// NOTE: Modifier that allow only for smart contract owner the access to specific function																																	
modifier onlyOwner() {																																	
require(msg.sender == owner	" """"You're not the owner!"""");"

}																																	
																																	
function vote_a() public{																																	
votes[0] += 1;																																	
}

function setResults() public onlyOwner {																																	
votes[0] = 0;

In your case you need to have A token to establish the connetion between the eclipse IDE and the github server.

I have seen that in some IDEs	 when you print something 																																
my question is that is it possible to have the same thing for jupyter notebook ?																																	
P.s:																																	
It would be better if it was customizable; like being able to change the background color of the new window.																																	
",https://stackoverflow.com/questions/71936600/how-to-print-something-in-a-new-window-in-jupyter-notebook,"																																	
You'd want the newer generation of Jupyter interface	 JupyterLab. (At least if you want this soon. I don't know what will be possible as Jupyter notebook 7 starts using more of the underlying machinery that JupyterLab uses.)																																
Default JupyterLab																																	
Using default current JupyterLab	 you can make a separate window for any output that you can drag around and arrange how you want. Right-click on an output cell and select from the menu 'Create New View for Output'. That will open a new window that respects the current JupyterLab theme. (There's a lot of theme adapting abilities so maybe that can provide what you need as far as background.) Once the new window is generated you can click and drag it around the JupyterLab window to arrange it relative to the notebook and then release when you have it outlined the way you want.You can try it right in your browser by clicking this link and letting the session spin up.																																
(This ability was covered in an answer to a similar question 'How to display Jupyterlab output in new tab?'.)																																	
Similarly	 you can have a window that keeps updating with the most recent output by using an attached console and toggling on 'Show All Kernel Activity'. When you have a notebook open	 the output will show at the bottom of this window as well. Even rich output like plots and dataframe displays. You can click on the tab and drag to arrange this window as you wish in the main JupyterLAb pane. See some example images using this here and here.																															
Related:																																	
It's not a separate window; however	 a nice feature of JupyterLab is switching to 'View' to 'Render Side-by-Side' where the output goes to the side of the code cell and not below. Alternatively	 see here.																															
Sidecar extension of JupyterLab																																	
There's an extension called sidecar for Jupyterlab that I believe has more options. I wonder if you could combine widgets to control the background as you seek. Don't know about the layering possibilities there.																																	
ipylab extension of JupyterLab																																	
ipylab has even more abilities than sidecar for customization	 with 'SplitPanel' and 'DockPanel'. Scroll through the examples shown to get an idea of the possibilities. There's also a 'launch binder' badge so you can try it out.																																
(You may also want to see Related projects listed at the bottom of ipylab's github page.)

I recently had a bug in my code caused by me resizing a vector and I had a variable that was referencing one of its elements.I found the bug	 but was wondering if there is a way to tell the compiler/IDE to throw an error if a variable is used after a specific point?																																
Totally stupid example	 but shows what I mean:																																
vector<int> a{0	1	3	4	5	6	7	8	9};																									
for (auto &value: a) {																																	
int copy=value;//totally stupid but makes sense if vector<int> was actually a vector<some big class> and we are only copying one value																																	
if (value==5) a.resize(a.size()+5);																																	
///value may no longer be valid after this point throw error if try to use value																																	
																																	
//can do stuff with copy but not value here																																	
}																																	
																																	
",https://stackoverflow.com/questions/71913394/in-c-can-i-add-a-note-that-a-reference-variable-is-no-longer-valid,"																																	
A way to achieve this is to take your file	 change the variables that you want to track for future use	 if you want to track a variable called foo	 rename it to foo_test in all its occurrences prior to the point you are interested about and try compiling/building/testing. If you get an error saying that foo was not defined	 then it is used later. If you do not get such an error	 you are no longer using it.

So it appears to be solved.I used my antique Codewright Editor to fix the line endings.Now with all endings as \r\n rather than some imported blocks of code with single \r (OS9 format) the text no longer has the strange squigly's and odd grouping.I'm going to suggest this is one huge major bug in the Delphi IDE.If the editor sees embedded CR without the trailing LF in some places and not in others it should pop up with a warning and even an option to 'fix' the file.Although the editor has the look of Codewright with search for regular expressions it was the hex beside ascii that verified I had single $0D characters between lines and not $0D$0A.

"As stated by others this most likely comes from strange characters in your code. Easiest """"on board"""" way to clean code from unwanted invisible characters is to us the format command. So any time I encounter weird behavior in code"	 I just do a quick format.

I switch between operating systems based on work enviroinment. But I hate to remember different keyboard shortcuts for different operating systems	 editors. Is there any better solution for this?																																
",https://stackoverflow.com/questions/72237414/what-are-the-editor-options-extensions-available-to-have-same-keyboard-shotcuts,"																																	
The disparity you are dealing with has multiple causes. One is that operating systems have different keybindings and even keyboard layouts so cross-platform native applicationsâ€”or cross-platform applications that try to feel nativeâ€”will inevitably have different shortcuts on different systems. Ctrl versus Cmd for starters. On top of that	 you are using different applications which	 have different shortcuts anyway.																															
From there	 you can explore a few roads.																																
One road is to remap your keyboard entirely at the system level. There are programs for that on both platforms and it might work if you use the same external keyboard on all systems.																																	
Another road is to do that remapping at the application level. Look for configuration options or third-party extensions.																																	
And another road is to choose a single application that ignores platform conventions. Technically	 Vim and Emacs fit the bill because they have been living in their own bubbles for decades but switching from full-fledged GUI IDEs to TUI editors is a hell of a challenge that will require a lot of effort learning	 before taking that road	 I would suggest you think long and hard about it.																														
FWIW	 I have been using Vim as my main driver for a little more than a decade but I don't treat it as an IDE because a) I know full well it can't be one no matter how hard you try to disguise it

You can go with the Snippets. Create any code snippet you like	 then add a keyboard shortcut to it. It gives the ability to not only insert snippet by a shortcut but also with a prefix (for example 'ifmain').																																
First	 you create code snippet. Navigate to File > Preferences > User snippets > python.json (or ctrl+shift+p 'configure user snippets'). Create any snippet here (in json syntax)																																
Example of snippet for code you provided:																																	
{																																	
"if name main"""": {"																																	
"prefix"""": """"ifmain"""""																																	
"body"""": ["																																	
"if __name__ == '__main__':"""""																																	
s = [1	2	4	" 5]"""""																														
"print(fun(s))"""""																																	
]																																	
"description"""": """"my cool snippet"""""																																	
}																																	
}																																	
																																	
Secondly	 you add a keyboard shortcut to snippet. File > Preferences > Keyboard shortcuts (ctrl+k ctrl+s). Then click small icon located on top right corner named 'Open Keyboard Shortcuts'																																
																																	
Add shortcut to the insert snippet command then save the file. Example:																																	
{																																	
"key"""": """"ctrl+k 1"""""																																	
"command"""": """"editor.action.insertSnippet"""""																																	
"when"""": """"editorTextFocus"""""																																	
"args"""": {"																																	
"langId"""": """"python"""""																																	
"name"""": """"if name main"""""																																	
}																																	
																																	
Press ctrl+k 1 > it will insert snippet. Start typing 'ifmain' then smash Tab > it will insert snippet.

You'll need a google account and to setup a billing profile but you won't be charged during the trial	 and it's a pretty generous trial in my opinion and I used it at work for 3 solid months without paying a dime.

This site helped me tremendously when learning SQL	 and absolutely fantastic once you've learned the basics of SQL. The site provides plenty of questions you must answer relying on SQL to query the datasets provided. This is all possible on the site which is great	 just click a question and go! You can also see other users submissions to the question so you can learn perhaps more efficient ways of getting to the answer.																															
MySQL																																	
Takes a bit of setup initially (compared to bigquery anyway)	 but once you're done you can use this as your playground for all things SQL related. More Details here.																																
For VSC to work as your interface for SQL	 you need to connect VSC to a SQL server. I've not done this myself but more details here.

This puts the tabs in but it does it BEFORE the new line is created and I can't figure out why.																																	
																																	
The short answer is that your binding happens before the built-in key bindings. Thus	 your function is called before the newline is actually inserted by tkinter.																																
You should have your code insert the newline	 perform your other actions																																
For a more thorough explanation of how bindings are processed	 see this answer																																
Here's a working example:																																	
def new_line_indent(self	 event):																																
# get the text of the current line																																	
"line = self.text.get(""""insert linestart"""""	" """"insert lineend"""")"																																
																																	
# insert the newline																																	
"self.text.insert(""""insert"""""	" """"\n"""")"																																
																																	
"# insert indentation if line ends with """":"""""																																	
"if line and line[-1] == """":"""":"																																	
																																	
# get current indentation	 then insert it																																
leading_whitespace = self.get_leading_whitespace(line)																																	
"self.text.insert(""""insert"""""	 leading_whitespace)																																
																																	
# add an additional level of indentation																																	
"self.text.insert(""""insert"""""	" """"\t"""")"																																
																																	
# since we already inserted the newline	 make sure that																																
# the default bindings do not																																	
"return """"break"""""																																	
																																	
def get_leading_whitespace(self	 line):																																
n = len(line) - len(line.lstrip())																																	
return line[:n]

This gives an idea on how to extend the editor to support type inferencing and code completion for your gradle script in Spring Tool Suite (aka Eclipse IDE).It is discussed further here: https://github.com/groovy/groovy-eclipse/issues/1125																																	
Pre-requisites:																																	
																																	
import Gradle API jar(s)																																	
install Groovy Development Tools																																	
add ~/.groovy/greclipse/global_dsld_support																																	
																																	
Create Gradle.dsld file in the dsld support directory with the following contents:																																	
def isBuildScript = fileExtension('gradle') & (~fileName('settings.gradle'))																																	
																																	
contribute(isBuildScript & isThisType()) {																																	
delegatesTo 'org.gradle.api.Project'																																	
}																																	
																																	
contribute(isBuildScript & isThisType() & enclosingCallName('task') & inClosure()) {																																	
delegatesTo 'org.gradle.api.Task'																																	
}																																	
																																	
Right-click on you build.gradle file and choose Open With > Groovy Editor.With a descriptor like this	 you will get:																																
																																	
As you can see	 it is by no means complete.But you can add to the DSLD and over time you can get quite a bit of assistance from the editor.If you share via the issue ticket (from above)

Confused as any newbie would be!																																	
I am a React Native newbie. Following a tutorial I created a project. I can use XCode to open the native iOS project in /iOS. What do I use for the javascript files in the root folder? Should I use a second editor for js - i.e. one of the standard js editors (Atom	 vi etc).What is the best-practice workflow? Or can I accomplish everything with one editor. Advice																																
CLARIFICATIOINS:																																	
To clarify my question	 take the following sample project:																																
I want to write a react native app which opens to a table view i.e. list screen with multiple items in a list screen. When you pick one item in the list the app navigates to a details screen. Suppose the list screen is React Native and the details screen is Native iOS.Ican code up the list screen using VSCode in React Native js. And then I can code the native details screen in XCode. So for the native part I can open XCode and create a fresh project. What kind of project should this be? Should it be an IOS App or am IOS framework/library? Perhaps a main app as the AppDelegate and a test harness	 and a framework/library for the one View Controller screen I will need to import into my React Native project? And then how do I run this to test and debug it out end to end in the simulator? I can possibly correct and live reload the React native portion	 what step do I need to go back to? etc.																															
",https://stackoverflow.com/questions/68041001/react-native-newbie-using-xcode-for-the-native-ios-part-in-ios-what-do-i-use,"																																	
It's not very common to do your coding work directly inside XCode. XCode is more of a place to organize your project/environment/builds/signing etc...																																	
Instead you should be writing all of your code inside the editor of your choice. The standard workflow would be:																																	
																																	
Create project on command line																																	
Use your editor of choice for coding. I use VSCode.																																	
in your editor	 open your project folder that you just created																																
use XCode for running the ios emulator and super specific iOS tasks																																	
All Android specific work can easily be done in VSCode (you don't ever actually need to use Android Studio)

I am working in a project where I am on a specific file in a folder	 the structure is like this:

Is there a way to navigate to the function createBoundary()'s definition in VSCode or CLion? I have already tried doing that by going to options and clicking """"Go to definition"""" but that didn't work and it only gave me a popup saying """"No definition was found""""."																																
PS. If the above said thing is not possible in both the mentioned IDEs and there's another IDE which facilitates that	 do let me know please.																																
",https://stackoverflow.com/questions/68622531/is-there-a-way-to-navigate-to-a-functions-definition-in-another-file-in-vscode,"																																	
Using the command Ctrl + P or Command + P you can input the fileName and navigate to a file in VSCode (plus	 it has some advanced features).																																
Now if you write myFile or myFile.cpp you can open the myFile.cpp and it also works for directories.																																	
writing components/index in the input takes you to somewhere where the folder's name is components and opens a file named index which is located inside of the components folder																																	
If you write myFile:122 it takes you to the file myFile.cpp and line 122.																																	
Now if you write myFile.cpp@createBoundary it opens the file myFile.cpp	 finds whatever value or function or anything that has the name createBoundary and puts the cursor on it.																																
If the createBoundary is inside of another object or function	 you can use myfile.cpp#createBoundary. So you don't have to navigate all the way down to the corresponding line of code.																																
By the way	 when you've already opened the file	 just #createBoundary or @createBoundary or :122 is enough that time.

",https://stackoverflow.com/questions/71784905/how-does-xdebug-know-about-breakpoints-in-an-ide,"																																	
When Xdebug first connects to the IDE	 the IDE sends over a list of breakpoints that it wants Xdebug to interrupt PHP at. If you have a look at a log file (made with xdebug.log=/tmp/xdebug.log)	 often line for a file/line breakpoint	 as well as the file name and line number.																														
When PHP runs code	 Xdebug intercepts the execution	" it pauses the execution and goes into command mode so that the IDE can send commands to inspect the current scope (by sending content_get) as well as further information about variables (with property_get). Then when you click """"Continue"""" or """"Step Over"""""	 the IDE sends a command to Xdebug to do the equivalent action.

",https://stackoverflow.com/questions/68015728/drools-ide-with-debugger,"																																	
Short answer is no	 there's no such a thing.																																
The closest thing you could use with latest Drools is the Eclipse Plugin	 but you have to use the 7.46.0.Final (source)																																
With IDEA community you can debug Drools' execution but you cannot put breakpoint inside consequences	 and you don't get syntax highlighting out of the box.																																
The IDEA Ultimate has a Drools plugin but it's not developed by the same team (it's made by JetBrains instead of Red Hat) and has plenty of bugs (source) I'm not even sure it's maintained anymore.																																	
Kogito has some VS Code tooling but still doesn't support DRL files.

How do I run my python script test.py	 which I coded in Pycharm	 with no python and Pycharm installed?																															
The other system can have python installed but no Pycharm.																																	
The script uses various excel files	 does the other system need to create the same folder structure to read the file.																																
",https://stackoverflow.com/questions/68007735/how-do-i-run-my-python-script-on-another-computer,"																																	
Convert that python file to a .exe file using auto-py-to-exe. This would convert your .py to .exe file which you can run anywhere.																																	
To use auto-py-to-exe	 just execute the following command on terminal pip install auto-py-to-exe.																																
Now on the terminal write auto-py-to-exe and press enter. Select the python file you wanna execute anywhere and click on Convert .py to .exe and you would get the folder containing .exe file. Transfer this folder to any computer and just by clicking the .exe file that is there inside the folder	 the program would start executing normally no matter if the computer does not have python or pycharm installed.																																
............................................................																																	
To run a python script from the command line of the other computer	 try:																																
python -m test.py																																	
																																	
If you need to run the script remotely	 look into ssh.																																
You will need to recreate the file system on the other system and install any dependencies.

You need to let the main AutoHotkey executable (or AHK-Studio.exe if it's compiled) through your firewall so that it can update and download its dependencies. It does this on every startup	 but you can disable it by creating an empty file called NoUpdate.txt in AHK-Studio's directory (where AHK-Studio.ahk is located)â€”but you'll probably want to let it update at least once after a fresh install

Try this link: https://github.com/maestrith/AHK-Studio/archive/master.zip																																	
This link works for me	 the other one may be down atm

Since this only happens with Windows 7 fresh installs (or without security updates).																																	
Here's how to fix:																																	
																																	
Install 2019 security updates																																	
Some other updates provided by ProtonVPN (while installing it will automatically install required updates)																																	
These 5 updates in order.																																	
																																	
After installing these three	 AHK-Studio can now access internet connection and complete downloading process.

Is it possible to configure the editor that when you type a tag like:																																	
body																																	
																																	
and hit enter/tab	 the editor will autocomplete it to:																																
body {																																	
																																	
}																																	
																																	
and indent the selection to where the first property would be typed?

",https://stackoverflow.com/questions/68587027/how-to-add-curly-brackets-and-indent-after-element-in-css-through-autocompletion,"																																	
Yes. A few different options:																																	
																																	
Type body { and hit Enter. With default settings the IDE will insert missing }	 add a new line and auto indent.																																
"This is controlled by options at """"Settings/Preferences | Editor | General | Smart Keys""""."																																	
																																	
Type body and hit Ctrl + Shift +Enter (or whatever other shortcut you may have there in your Keymap for Code | Code Completion | Complete Current Statement action).																																	
																																	
Write your own snippet (using Live Templates) that once expanded will replace the trigger code by inserting the snippet instead.																																	
Lets assume that you have selected bb as the abbreviation for this snippet. Then typing bb and hitting Tab (or whatever other expand key you may select for this) will inert the whole block at once.

For the Online Java Installation	 Should I need to connect to the internet all the time while working on IDE? and also After Installation of Java Windows Online

Offline version is a huge installation file that includes everything needed for installation.																																	
It means that the computer doesn't need to be connected to the web during installation of Java.																																	
This version is ideal for installation on multiple machines	 because it only downloads the data once.																																
																																	
Online version is a small installer program that then needs to download the needed installation files when executed.																																	
It means that the computer requires a web connection during installation of Java.																																	
This version is good for installation on only one machine	 because it only downloads the data that is actually needed.																																
																																	
																																	
............................................................																																	
Online installation expects you to be connected all the time till the installation process is finished	 i.e. it needs constant internet connectivity.																																
Offline installation assumes you're not going to be connected throughout the installation process	 so it's a stand-alone installer	 once you download the offline installation files	 you don't need internet anymore for installation	 it is self-sufficient.

How can I set the Delphi IDE main window height to be greater than the height of the monitor on which it is displayed?																																	
I have 4 HD monitors	 arranged in a square																																
If I start Delphi (v11 Alexandria on Win 11 Pro	 but I doubt that matters) in	 the top-left monitor then I can drag the right-hand edge of the IDE main window all the way to the far right of the top-right monitor. So	 the IDE can be as wide as two monitors if I want.																														
However	 if I try to drag the bottom edge of the IDE main window to increase its height beyond the monitor height then I cannot do it. The window refuses to get any higher than the height of the monitor on which the title bar is displayed (1080 pixels in my case).																																
It behaves as if there is a hard limit on the height of the IDE (not allowed to be greater than the height of the monitor). If this is the case then I do not understand it - why allow the user to increase the IDE width across multiple monitors but not the height?																																	
If anyone knows how to work around this restriction then I would love to learn about it.

I contacted Embarcadero and they logged the issue as RS-110947. They also sent me a package to install - and this has fixed the problem. However	 they have asked me not to upload this package to StackOverflow because it is not official (just something the support agent wrote to test what was possible). It will be officially fixed in a future release.

I have heard that it is a good practice to stick to the same IDE version for a particular firmware development project across the team and always use the same version while development and fixes are done on it in future. One has to be careful in upgrading the IDE versions for the same project even if newer versions are available.																																	
I was in a scenario where we were developing firmware using Atollic truestudio and using FreeRTOS. Although newer versions of both IDE and FreeRtos were available	 we were advised to stick to the version which used for initial development.																																
What is the exact reason for doing so?																																	
If we are upgrading to newer versions	 what do we need to be careful about?																																
",https://stackoverflow.com/questions/69726817/importance-of-ide-compiler-version-in-embedded-firmware-development,"																																	
Sometimes it doesn't matter	 and sometimes it really does.																																
For example	 I've worked on a part where we ROMed some portions of the C runtime library because every byte of program memory counted.																																
Once you've done that	 you invite catastrophe if you change tools and either try to link to the old pieces of CRT or need to not use those anymore so you lose the blob of memory you are counting on for the application to fit.																																
Another case is moving from one set of revision of tools to another.Keil 5.x to 6.x changed compilers and changed the linker descriptor files	 and other linker symbol names	 etc.We'd have to go and touch a lot of our back end processing to form our firmware image correctly.																															
The IDE	 though?Meh. Who uses the IDE project files																																
(FWIW	 changing Cmake versions on our current build environment could cause us pain																																
Then there's the old adage:if it ain't broke	 then don't fix it.																																
............................................................																																	
The short version of the answer is repeatability.																																	
We all save the source code for our programs in a version control system and build from a release branch so that we always know exactly what we are shipping in our product	 right? (Hopefully).																																
But the application source code is just one part of the puzzle.																																	
The compiler and the support functions which come with and IDE or an RTOS are also programs.																																	
Those programs are changed by their creators from time to time. There are improvements	 sometimes bug fixes																																
That means that we are not using the exact same compiler or RTOS (for example) when we upgrade	 and we cannot guarantee that they will produce exactly the same image	 if we upgrade them.																															
There could be compiler improvements which optimize better	 and therefore produce a slightly different image as output.																																
There could be changes in the RTOS behavior which could affect the timing of the system.																																	
There could even be new bugs introduced while improvements are made an old bugs are fixed.																																	
This means that if we change the underlying tools	 we need to perform a complete verification to insure that the system we make has exactly the same behavior and performance characteristics as before.																																
I was literally discussing this with the Director of Firmware at our company yesterday.																																	
We talked about how everyone has to continually choose between the stability of keeping the tools the same	 and the potential benefits of upgrading the tools.																																
Since we are working on our next product	 we have the opportunity to upgrade our tools before the product is released	 but even the operating system version used by our developers and our build machine.

Note: I actually stumbled across this behavior in RStudio on MacOS yet I assume it is rather about Java/JS.																																	
When you place your cursor right after a number you can increment/decrement it via OPTION + SHIFT + ARROW UP/DOWN (or CNTRL + SHIFT + ARROW UP/DOWN for windows. This shortcut probably invokes the keybinding modifyNumberUp / modifyNumberDown. However	 it also toggles the word pairs add/remove and next/previous.																																
																																	
What is going on here? Is it actually JS or something else?																																	
Why does this happen? What is the purpose?																																	
Is there a list of words that are defined that way?

I have a webapp that was created prior the new GAS IDE was launched. Recently I noticed that while using the new GAS IDE	 if I save my changes and proceed to publish those through a new deployment with the tested application's latest code using the new IDE	 which was months old).																															
I searched online and I couldn't find any reports of this issue.																																	
is there something I should be doing to ensure that my webapp runs on the latest deployment as opposed to an old deployment version?																																	
just in case you wonder	 I did make sure I was publishing the exec version of my webapp when I tested the execution (link obtained from the new ide). I was not using a dev version or any other kind.																																
",https://stackoverflow.com/questions/68477172/new-google-apps-scripts-ide-deployment-issues,"																																	
I managed to get the webapp deployment versioning publishing issue fixed by switching back to the legacy editor and doing the republishing/deployment from there. After that	 the code being executed on the execution log showed my latest deployment being run on the published webapp.																																
Weird	 anyways.

I have recently been working with Pycharm for Robot Framework and everything was going fine until I decided to get adventurous with one of the plugins. While I was meant to use a Intellibot plugin from a GitHub website	(https://github.com/lte2000/intellibot#intellijpycharm-plugin-for-robot-automation-framework)																																
All of a sudden then	 Pycharm decides to restart ( thought it was a normal process	 it requests to be restarted) but did not restart again. Hence I tried opening it on my own	 and all it kept showing was as screenshot attached. Only the loading screen	 without ever opening.																													
																																	
I checked my task manager and it wasn't using any CPU	 but was open as a 'background process'																																
I have also tried running with the cmd	 and what shows was a line of errors																																
																																	
It looks like the obvious problem to my problems with Pycharm is this plugin	 and i was wondering what I could do in order to open Pycharm without a problem.																																
Thank you in advance.

You must to use the VS Code and to open a folder or a workspace.

Premise																																	
With a properly maintained JSDoc	 almost any modern IDE can identify a type mismatch (of assignments																																
Besides that	 modern JS comes with a predictable variable scoping	 modularization	 built-in classes support	 and many other.																													
																																	
Question																																	
																																	
In which scenario may TypeScript serve developer needs better than JS+JSDoc?																																	
																																	
Notes: I'm talking about the cases	 where the support of legacy JS/browsers is mandatory and TS + Babel can transpile the modern codebase to some legacy-friendly environment.																																
",https://stackoverflow.com/questions/68421854/jsdoc-ide-vs-typescript,"																																	
I think this is a little weird of a comparison. JSDoc is documentation oriented	 while typescript adds optional static typing to js. These tools do have some parts in common	 but their purpose is different.																															
It's an interesting question though. I'd like to encourage a discussion on the topic	 so I'm going to talk from my experience with the tools.																																
The main issue I have with jsdoc is that the following part is crucial:																																	
																																	
properly maintained JSDoc																																	
																																	
The usefulness of jsdoc for autocompletion depends directly on the effort and quality of the jsdoc comments. I found it hard to enforce in big projects. Complex types/interfaces are also a pain to describe and maintain	 being extremely verbose. Ts on the other hand is a lot more concise than jsdoc.																																
Furthermore	 types and interfaces in ts are first class citizens	 that come with ts.																															
Back to the enforcing guidelines part. With ESLint you can setup flexible rules that will allow you to fine tune restrictions/styles/guidelines for your types. You want rigidly static types? Or you want leniency?																																	
You can have your exact needs enforced and hooked up to ci/cd if you want. In my eyes that's a big bonus when working on big projects.																																	
Tooling is also an important factor	 both jsdoc and ts are mature enough to have ecosystems around them. Although at this point in time jsdoc isn't an active project																																
So it all comes down to your needs	 if you're happy with what jsdoc can do for you and documentation is your main focus																																
P.S.																																	
Ts and jsdoc aren't mutually exclusive. You can have both	 although you might want to switch to something like TSDoc																																
............................................................																																	
Various Js compiler like Typescript and Closure officially supports type checking using JSDoc https://www.typescriptlang.org/docs/handbook/jsdoc-supported-types.html																																	
Itâ€™s a valid option if you want to type check Js source code.

About every 5 - 10 minutes I get a pop-up asking to authorize to GitHub with either sign-in (which I've done) or using a token.

You may know that when you select your code by default in the VS-Code, the cursor itself selects anything since you stay in the same column of a ""code's paragraph"". However, this is not the case, some time ago I installed VIM extension and since that moment when I have to select a entire paragraph I have to move the cursor until the end of a line to select that because shortcuts doesn't work to do that.
This is the example of what I'm talking about(I stayed at a code's part but in the same column so I select that with the intention to select the entire paragraph, so this is the result):
Selection with no ""alt"" shortcut
I need help to solve this problem since I've proven the settings of the IDE and even reinstall the extensions, so I'd be so granted for your help, Thx!.

Uncheck:

The code compiles okay but it doesn't upload.
The code is :
int fsrPin = 0; // the FSR and 10K pulldown are connected to a0
int fsrReading; // the analog reading from the FSR resistor divider
 
void setup(void) {
Serial.begin(115200); 
}
 
void loop(void) {
fsrReading = analogRead(fsrPin);
 
Serial.print(""Analog reading = "");
Serial.print(fsrReading); // print the raw analog reading
 
if (fsrReading < 10) {
Serial.println("" - No pressure"");
} else if (fsrReading < 200) {
Serial.println("" - Light touch"");
} else if (fsrReading < 500) {
Serial.println("" - Light squeeze"");
} else if (fsrReading < 800) {
Serial.println("" - Medium squeeze"");
} else {
Serial.println("" - Big squeeze"");
}
delay(1000);
}

And the error is like this:
avrdude: stk500_getsync() attempt 2 of 10: not in sync: resp=0x41
avrdude: stk500_recv(): programmer is not responding
avrdude: stk500_getsync() attempt 3 of 10: not in sync: resp=0x41

I have checked all the ports and code and everything seems fine yet the avr dude error keeps popping up

I want to see how the JVM interpreter works. Can I track function calls using NetBeans or GDB? And how will it be more convenient to do this? I'm interested in starting HelloWorld with the -Xint option and see what steps are taken and see the interpreter source code.
I mean not only the result of the interpreter, but also the interpreter code itself in the HotSpot sources.
I built OpenJDK 8 from source with --with-debug-level=slowdebug option.
"	"
If you want to get an idea how JVM interpreter works, you'd better build HotSpot with a C++ interpreter. To do this, pass CC_INTERP=true to the make command.
This is a simplified version of the bytecode interpreter, written mostly in C++. The primary source file (which implements the main interpreter loop and most bytecodes) is in bytecodeInterpreter.cpp. You can easily debug this code in your favorite IDE. However, this interpreter implementation is not actually used in a production JVM; its purpose is to experiment and to prototype new ports quickly.
The real interpeter (aka Template Interpreter) is written in a platform-specific macroassembler, its sources are in src/cpu/<arch>/vm/templateInterpreter_<arch>.cpp and src/cpu/<arch>/vm/templateTable_<arch>.cpp. This interpreter is generated dynamically at JVM startup, so it's not easy to debug it: first, because this is the assembly code; second, because there is no direct mapping from the generated code to the original source files.
-XX:+PrintInterpreter option will dump the disassembled template interpreter.
Also, there is -XX:+TraceBytecodes flag in debug builds of HotSpot. When enabled, it calls the trace function before executing each bytecode instruction. This can be helpful while debugging the interpreter.

How to show blue dot icons when files were modified with Git in PhpStorm IDE like this picture?

Please help me setup for this in PhpStorm IDE. Thank you so much.
"	"
PhpStorm (and other IDEA-based IDEs) does not have such dots. Instead the file name color is used to specify the VCS file status.

Default colors and their meaning can be seen here: https://www.jetbrains.com/help/phpstorm/project-tool-window.html#file_status_highlight

You can see and change those colors at Settings (Preferences on macOS) | Version Control | File Status Colors

The IDE can mark the actual folders with colors as well. There is an option for that (see https://stackoverflow.com/a/30915650/783119 for details). These days it's located at Settings (Preferences on macOS) | Version Control | Confirmation screen and is called Highlight directories that contain modified files in the Project tree.
The colors that will be used here (so you can change them if needed): Have changed descendants and Have immediate changed children.

I am trying to find a specific colour scheme for Visual Studio Code (it's the same colour scheme that an instructor uses in an online course). I have a screenshot of it (attached). I find this colour scheme to be particularly good for my eyes so I really want to find which one it is. How to find out which one it is? Thanks
This is the Visual Studio colour scheme I am looking for
"	"
I finally found that the palette I was looking for was very similar to some Monodevelop colors, I actually ended up building a new theme for Visual Studio Code based on that, and published it as an extension for Visual Studio Code, called it MonoDevKai since it's supposed to be a mix between Monodevelop and dark versions of Monokai. As of writing this, it's not very customized but I plan to customize it a bit more in the future. You can find the theme as an extension in the Visual Studio Code marketplace here https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=Heracles.monodevkai
or install it directly from Visual Studio Code extensions panel.

Google has failed me. I'd like a way to have TypeScript syntax validation in my Ace editor. I've found an Ace-based TypeScript Playground by basarat AKA 'That TypeScript Guy' but the repo has no good README and I doubt the validator is up to date with TypeScript's newer features, as the last commit is from years ago.
I understand how to add the custom listing itself in Ace; it's just the actual TypeScript linter I am struggling to find. It seems there is no up-to-date maintained one; I'm surprised there isn't one. Currently, I debounce a call to get diagnostics via a library called ts-morph, which provides developer-friendly methods for the TypeScript compiler API. I get those diagnostics, loop over them, and add my own custom annotations to the editor:
const diagnostics = getDiagnostics(code)
aceEditor.getSession().setAnnotations(
diagnostics.map(diagnostic => {
return {
row: diagnostic.getLineNumber() - 1,
column: diagnostic.getStart(),
text: diagnostic.getMessageText().toString(),
type: convertTypeScriptCategoryToAceType(diagnostic.getCategory()),
}
})
)

This is okay for now, but I'd like to do it the 'Ace' way with a Web Worker in the format they suggest.
I am slightly open to migrating away from Ace Editor; for example I also know about TypeScript Playground, but this doesn't seem to have an open-source repository. Other famous online IDEs, like CodeSandbox also must have their ways of doing it. (I looked a little bit into CodeSandbox's source but their repository is expectedly quite complex.)
Can anybody provide me insight into getting nice TypeScript IntelliSense and syntax checking in a web-based IDE? Is it possible via current open source tools?

When using PyCharm tab only indents the line if I select it first. This is not the same with VSCode which adds an indent of, I think, 4 spaces each time I press the tab key. I believe this is a bug but I have tried everything I have found and nothing seems to work.
Things I have tried:

Remapping the tab key to indent line (this only works if the line is selected)
Using Smart Tab
Using Use Tab Character

None of these have fixed the issue
"	"
It is not a bug, as the default behaviour is common on editors (also way before VS). It is not uncommon to make tables (e.g. on C header files, defining constants). VS took a different way. Note: in PyCharm (at least with KDE key bindings), if you select one or more lines, then Tab (and Shift-Tab) will indent/unindent the code.
But you can reproduce your desired behaviour: Go on settings/preferences, then Keymap menu. I recommend you to save current settings, and start a new custom setting (e.g. adding ""Tab"" to the name).
Then on the right of the right/bottom search field, look for actions with a key: press it, then press Tab. You see that there is an action ""Tab"", which links to Tab. Right click, and remove the key. We need this, not to conflict with the new behaviour of Tab (only this matter, we keep the other Tab).
Now we should give Tab the desired behaviour: On Keymap -> Editor Actions -> Indent Line or Selection (note: you can just look ""Indent Line""). Here you select your new key to be Tab (you should press the + for such special keys).
Now the settings seems similar to VS. I'm not using it much, so e.v. you should tweak other settings. Note, on my KDE keybindings, Shift+Tab is already set as Unindent.
............................................................
Go to settings ---> editor ----> code style ----> check the box for ""detect and use existing file indents for editing"".
Under Code style again, select Python. At the right hand side, you will see Tab size, ensure it's 4, the indent should also be 4

............................................................
in the setting | keymap, select Windows (not Windows copy) or click reset.

Hi some days before I updated my eclipse 2021-06 to 2021-09 and after that its code completion will not show all the methods and classes. For example if I type frame.setS, then it is showing no default proposals.

But At the same time when I type frame.setC and press ctrl+space, it is working This is the

Also in my settings everything is checked.

What I have tried

I searched the web and found many stack overflow questions and I tried the answers. But it didn't work

I deleted the .metedata folder and uninstalled and reinstalled eclipse for 5 times.

I tried installing eclipse from installer and zip.


Is this a bug or something.
I have also installed the java 17 plugin from eclipse marketplace.
Edit

java.awt.* is not filtered out. So no problem. Also it has Java-17 support..

In Eclipse 2021-09 (4.21) everything of java.awt.* is filtered out in the content assist by default.
To disable this default filter, go to the preferences (Window > Preferences; in macOS in the application menu) Java > Appearance > Type Filters and uncheck the checkbox java.awt.*.
I reported it to Eclipse and it has been fixed within two weeks, so it will be in the next release Eclipse 2021-12 (4.22) that will be released on December 8, 2021 (and also sooner in the milestone builds starting with M2):

it cycles many minutes and does nothing after all.

"	"
I tested this on Windows 10. First I installed the community edition of IntelliJ IDEA on Windows from here. Then I opened the IDE and installed the Perl plugin as described here :

Then configured the plugin by going to Settings->Languages & Frameworks->Perl5 :

Click the cogwheel at the right side of Perl5 Interpreter and select your installed Perl exe (I am using Strawberry Perl):

Close the settings dialog and choose File->New project.. and select Perl5 from the list:

click Next and then choose the Perl interpreter to use:

Choose a project name and its location:

Click the name of the project in the project view at the left side of the window, and choose File->New->Perl5 file. Type in the name of the script, and choose Script from the list :

Type in the hello.pl script in the editor:

Select Run->Run.. from the menu, and click Add new.. configuration:

In the dialog enter a new name for the run configuration, and enter the location of the script:

Then click Run and you should get output like this:

Whenever I call beautifyCode(), the formatting of the code does changes, but it all comes on one line with varying spaces... Is this how it works or am I doing something wrong? Also, how can I solve this as an issue?
Code:
var beautify = ace.require(""ace/ext/beautify""); // get reference to extension
var editor = ace.edit(""editor"");

// This function is called to beautify the editor's code
function beautifyCode()
{
beautify.beautify(editor.getSession());

}

Input:
<html>
<head>
 <title>Hello World</title>
</head>
<body>
<form action=""shyam.php"">
<input name=""name"" value=""Shyam""/>
<input type=""submit""/>
</form>
</body>
</html>

Output:
<html><head> <title>Hello World</title></head><body><form action=""shyam.php""><input name=""name"" value=""Shyam""/><input type=""submit""/></form></body></html>

Please let me know if any more information is needed.

I solved the issue while trying to implement auto-complete for my editor.
You might need to import other scripts as well to ensure that the beautifier works.
<script src=""https://cdnjs.cloudflare.com/ajax/libs/ace/1.4.12/ext-language_tools.js""></script>

The above script solved the issue for me.

I have Delphi XE7 installed on a Windows Server 2012 R2 (64 bit).

My 2 main folders are CMS and nextjs as shown below:

But when I go to run 1 folder it uses my localhost:3000 then the other also wants to use the same port but this is not possible as I get an error saying port 3000 already in use.
Basically I want to run my CMS folder and nextjs folder in 2 different ports.
I have attached my launch.json code just incase:
{
""version"": ""0.2.0"",
""configurations"": [
{
""type"": ""node"",
""request"": ""launch"",
""name"": ""Launch Program"",
""skipFiles"": [
""<node_internals>/**""
],
""program"": ""${workspaceFolder}\\nextjs\\.next\\server\\pages\\index.js""
}
]
} 

"	"
Next.js
You have to edit the package.json.
In the script object you'll find a property named dev. You can edit it like this (ex: port 3005) :
""dev"": ""next dev -p 3005""
When you will launch npm run dev, you app will turn on port 3005
Strapi
Add a .env file at the root of your project and add a variable with the port you want:
PORT=3627

When I am using replit I can remove the little symbol that appears when I drag and drop in a csv file so my main.py can read it, otherwise I get invalid literal base 10 issue. I am trying to run this on local machine with sublime text and getting same error now as it is reading the file from the directory, so I assume it is adding this symbol in before reading.... I can click on the csv file in replit and edit, but cannot do this in sublime.
Can someone explain what this is for? HOw can I get it to read the basic comma delimited numbers in the file (It is a game tile map).
with open(f'level{level}_data.csv', newline= '') as csvfile:
reader = csv.reader(csvfile, delimiter=',')

Saved it is comma delimited csv instead of UTF-8 comma delimited csv. It then imports without the 'question mark in a diamon' symbol. I understand this is an unrecognised special character, but I have nothing apart from integers in my table. Maybe someone could clarify that?...

I have been working on this project for a while. What Ascii does is when we run the program, it asks for a picture, and after we give it the picture it changes it into symbols/letters
if u still didn't understand, read this:
ASCII art is a graphic design technique that uses computers for presentation and consists of pictures pieced together from the 95 printable characters defined by the ASCII Standard from 1963 and ASCII compliant character sets with proprietary extended characters.
so here is the code I wrote in python (Pycharm, a Python IDE):
import PIL.Image

ASCII_CHARS = [""@"", ""#"", ""S"", ""%"", ""?"", ""*"", ""+"", "";"", "":"", "","", "".""]


def resize_image(image, new_width=100):
width, height = image.size
ratio = height / width / 1.65
new_height = int(new_width * ratio)
resized_image = image.resize((new_width, new_height))
return(resized_image)

def grayify(image):
grayscale_image = image.convert(""L"")
return(grayscale_image)

def pixels_to_ascii(image):
pixels = image.getdata()
charecters = """".join([ASCII_CHARS[pixel//25] for pixel in pixels])
return(charecters)

def main(new_width=100):
path = input(""Enter a valid pathname to an image :\n"")
try:
image = PIL.Image.open(path)
except:
print(path, ""is not a valid pathname to an image"")

new_image_data = pixels_to_ascii(grayify(resize_image(image)))

pixel_count = len(new_image_data)
ascii_image = '\n'.join(new_image_data[i:(i+new_width)] for i in range(0, pixel_count, new_width))

print(ascii_image)

with open(""ascii_image.txt"", ""w"") as f:
f.write(ascii_image)
main()

and every time I run this I have 0 errors, 0 warnings, 0 weak warnings, and 0 typos. But it doesn't work and shows this:
Process finished with exit code 0

and nothing else, how can I fix this and make it work...

You are calling main() function inside the main() function itself, hence there is no output. 
You should place main() without any indentation:
def main():
# code

main()

Best Practices for calling main() function:
if __name__ == ""__main__"":
main()

So that you can reuse this program further without execution of main function in any import.
One more thing, you are not doing anything in main function after opening image with PIL hence no output, and you should not write import PIL.Image if you are using PIL.Image, you should use import PIL, else it is recommended to use from PIL import Image when you want to use Image class from PIL. You are also using image inside the body of except.
Suggestions: 
You are taking path to image file as input which is somewhat annoying to the user, you can use tkinter.filedialog to get file path like this:
from tkinter.filedialog import askopenfilename
.
.
def main():
path = askopenfilename(filetypes=((""Images"", [""*.jpg"", ""*.png"", ""*.jpeg""]), ))

Wanted to create a _ideavimrc file but I cannot find the commands that Rider uses.
Such list exists in VisualStudio under Tools | Options | Environment | Keyboard .
Example command being: Build.BuildSolution. Then I could use it in my _vsvimrc file (for VsVim).
But I cannot find such a list on Rider.
"	"
Following this blog post :

There are two ways to find the action ids.
First, while in normal mode in the editor, type:
:actionlist
This will show the full list of action ids.
However, itâ€™s hard to find what youâ€™re looking for this way.
This is why I like the second method.
From the action menu enable IdeaVim: Track Action Ids.
Then using your mouse (I know, just for this time), use the feature you want. > Finally, you will find the name of the action in the Event Log.

I installed PyCharm on Ubuntu 18.04 by extracting the tarball into /etc/ and creating a shortcut through the Tools menu.
I installed IdeaVim through the marketplace, and the Vim plug-in is working as expected.
Now I want to import my vim settings from my .vimrc. I just copied the .vimrc to ~/.ideavimrc and reloaded my IDE. However, my remappings are not working. I tried sourcing the rc file using :source ~/.ideavimrc, but this doesn't work either.
The only content of my .ideavimrc file is this line:
xnoremap p pgvy

I really hate the paste-setting of vim, so I need this remapping and I'm lost. Thanks for the help.

I'm debugging a python code in visual studio code. I have employed breakpoints. I got an error and corrected it. How can I restart from that error point? (I mean, how can I avoid re-running everything from the beginning.) Also, let me know if there is a way in any other IDE.

This is called hot reloading, but it comes with a cost
this seems to be your best bet, https://github.com/breuleux/jurigged
also this is a duplicate of hot reloading / swapping with Python

You need to add this in the launch.json file:

I realize this is a very beginner question so please bear with me. I recently started my first project in Solidity having come from solely using Python. When working with Python I constantly injected print statements to check the output of my work and ensure all was going to plan.
I'm having immense difficulty replicating this same workflow with Solidity. Even on the IDE front, I used PyCharm with Python which has a run command and output window but I can't find anything comparable Solidity. I'm using Sublime Text but that seems to be good for just writing the actual code and I can't find a way to call functions/mappings etc to a window to check output.
Remix has more features than most, but I'd prefer a local development environment. I've been looking for a while now and feel like I'm looking all the wrong places and not sure why the answer is so difficult to find for what seems like a simple issue. Any insight would be amazing.
Thanks!
"	"
Solidity has no command line output to display debug values. Which can persuade you to write simpler functions that follow the single-responsibility principle and test their input/output separately.
So instead of writing a long function that does everything and is hard to know what's happening mid-execution
function transfer(uint256 _tokenId) external {
require(msg.sender == ownerOf(_tokenId)
|| isApprovedForAll(ownerOf(_tokenId), msg.sender)
|| msg.sender == getApproved(_tokenId), 'Sender not allowed');

if (approved != address(0x0)) {
tokenApprovals[_tokenId] = address(0x0);
emit Approval(_tokenOwner, address(0x0), _tokenId);
}

// ... etc
}

you can break the functionality into smaller parts (easier to test separately). And if you need, you can connect them in one function.
function transfer(uint256 _tokenId) {
address tokenOwner = ownerOf(_tokenId);
address approved = getApproved(_tokenId);

require(isSenderAllowed(_tokenId, tokenOwner, approved), 'Sender not allowed');

if (approved != address(0x0)) {
_removeApproval(_tokenId, tokenOwner);
}

// ... etc
}

function isSenderAllowed(uint256 _tokenId, address _tokenOwner, address _approved) external view returns (bool) {
return (msg.sender == _tokenOwner
|| isApprovedForAll(_tokenOwner, msg.sender)
|| msg.sender == _approved);
}

function _removeApproval(uint256 _tokenId, address _tokenOwner) private {
tokenApprovals[_tokenId] = address(0x0);
emit Approval(_tokenOwner, address(0x0), _tokenId);
}


A small workaround for debugging (on a local blockchain such as Ganache or the Remix VM emulator) can be using event logs. You can see them in the transaction return object (if the tx wasn't reverted). However, it's not a good practice, and I'd still recommend writing simplest possible functions instead, so that you don't have to debug that much.
contract MyContract {
event LogString(string memory _value);
event LogAddress(address _value);

function foo() external {
emit LogString(""myString"");
emit LogAddress(address(0x123));
}
}

Someone can help me how to make a regular expression to convert all strings like:
$_POST['key']

To:
$_key

This will not be used in the code itself, but I will use it in my IDE, to facilitate a bulk change.
Thanks.
"	"
You should be able to do something like:
\$_[A-Z].*\['(\w.*)']

Replacing it with:
$_$1

Tested on Sublime Text 3 with the following data:
$_POST['key']
$_POST['asd']
$_POST['ser']
$_POST['fsdf']
$_POST['kefas23y']
$_GET['key']
$_GET['asd']
$_GET['ser']
$_GET['fsdf']
$_GET['kefas23y']

Output:
$_key
$_asd
$_ser
$_fsdf
$_kefas23y
$_key
$_asd
$_ser
$_fsdf
$_kefas23y

Explanation:
\$ - Escape the dollar sign as it's a regex special character
[A-Z].* - Assuming only PHP Superglobals being replaced, look for any number of capital letters
\['(\w.*)'] - Create a group of any number of word characters within single quotations and brackets
$_$1 - Replace the text with literal $_ followed by the first group matched in the line - The text in brackets

I'm trying to get ""go to definition"" working for a JUCE project created with Projucer. I've tried both CLion and Visual Studio Code, but they can't seem to find definitions that live in the JUCE libraries.
I'm on Ubuntu. Is there a blessed path for this? I'm normally a vim user, but I'm willing to try any IDE.
"	"
I've just figured this out!
In VS Code go View and Command Palette and type C/C++: Edit Configurations (UI) which will take to the IntelliSense Configurations page. Under Include path, on a new line, specify the path to JUCE e.g. ~/JUCE/**.

Note: The two stars are needed to tell VS Code to look through subdirectories.

This will create a hidden folder .vscode in your project folder with this configuration.

You will need to repeat these steps for each project you make.

Definitions and code completion should now work.

To compile your code, in your project folder go Builds then LinuxMakefile and in a terminal run the command make. Finally, go to the builds folder and run your project ./exampleProject.

............................................................
You need to add the JUCE/modules folder to your search path, not the top-level JUCE/ folder!
If you're using the Projucer, you'll also need to add the JuceLibrarySource/ folder to your search path.
............................................................
What I ended up doing was using FRUT to convert my project from a Projucer project to a CMake project. CLion was able to understand the CMake project, and thus, the ""go to definition"" and autocomplete features started working.

You need to set JAVA_HOME variable to run Android Studio .
Steps to set JAVA_HOME variable:

locate your java installation directory.

Open Command Prompt (make sure you Run as administrator so you're able to add a system environment variable).

make sure to replace [JDK PATH] with your java installation directory.

WSL2, Windows 11, Goland GoLand 2022.1.2. Same problem.
IDE restart didn't help, what helped is to restart the WSL2 env:
wsl --shutdown ubuntu

Before restart you should close the IDE.
............................................................
Was seeing this issue in both intelliJ and PyCharm at the same time
for the same file. I did not check if the issue persisted with any
other file (perhaps should have).
Though that putting the IDE in power save mode may have done it but
removing from power save mode did not work. Restarting the IDE by invalidating cache did not help either.
Then I realized that I had put that particular file to be assumed as
unchanged by running git update-index --assume-unchanged <filename>
Once I undid that by running git update-index --no-assume-unchanged <filename>, the warning went away - and the IDE showed all of the
lines properly annotated again.

I've realized it was simply by activating the ""Use Regex"" option in Find and Replace (the "".*"" button at the right side) and escaping the first \n expression with another backlash.

the code below is to create a challenge that prompts for user input between several 0 - 20.

However, after compiling and running my code in the code blocks ide, it only prompted the user once before printing out the condition five times and exiting the loop. (So for instance, if the user input is less than the randomNumber, it will go on to print ""Your number is wrong, is less than"" five times when it should prompt the user after the first failed try.)
Does anyone have any idea what is wrong with my code? Or is it the IDE's problem? Thanks!

I am using Sublime Text 3 in Windows 10. I am trying to output a simple program in an output file. Earlier it was working fine, but now it is giving some strange alphanumeric characters as output whenever I am trying to output something.
Here's my build profile:
{
""cmd"": [""g++.exe"",""-std=c++17"", ""${file}"", ""-o"", ""${file_base_name}.exe"", ""&&"" , ""${file_base_name}.exe<inputf.in>outputf.in""],
""shell"":true,
""working_dir"":""$file_path"",
""selector"":""source.cpp""

Sample input
#include <iostream>
using namespace std;
int main() {
for (int i = 0; i < 10; i++) {
cout << i << endl;
}
}

Output:
300d 0a31 0d0a 320d 0a33 0d0a 340d 0a35
0d0a 360d 0a37 0d0a 380d 0a39 0d0a

It happened with me also; I use C++14 in sublime text 3.
I would suggest to delete your sublime build file and create the same again, and your ""inputf.in"" and ""outputf.in"" files should be present in the same folder.
There's a common confusion, as we copy the sublime build file from somewhere and there may be different file names for input and output files, so match them with yours, otherwise you'll get an error - ""system can't find file specified"".

I think the answer is to write a runtime annotation to scan all @dangerous methods and print the warning log. Then write an IDE plugin to coloring dangerous method

Can I add an extra folding part to my code? like as it does for if, for, etc. just dol the part I want to. (look at the picture) is there any shortcut to do this or any extra extensions?
I'm using Clion. but if you know this for any other IDEs I like to hear that.
thanks in advance
this is an example of what I meant
"	"
This applies specifically to CLion.
A shortcut
You're going to want to select the code in question, and press Ctrl + Alt + T (on Windows at least). That shows a drop-down menu. One of the options available is <editor-fold...> Comments. Select that, and you're good to go.
Manual input
Another approach is to add the markers yourself. Say you want to add foldability to:
int i = 0, j = 0;
char c; 

Then you can just add:
//<editor-fold desc=""Description"">
int i = 0, j = 0;
char c;
//</editor-fold> 

The desc attribute is optionnal but pretty cool, it displays your description when the code is folded.

I am using sublime to code python scripts. The following code is for selenium in python to install the driver automatically by using the webdriver_manager package
# pip install webdriver-manager
from selenium import webdriver
from selenium.webdriver.chrome.service import Service
from webdriver_manager.chrome import ChromeDriverManager
from selenium.webdriver.common.by import By

driver = webdriver.Chrome(ChromeDriverManager().install())
driver.maximize_window()

#s=Service(path)
#driver=webdriver.Chrome(service=s)
driver.get('https://www.google.com')
driver.find_element(By.NAME, 'q').send_keys('Yasser Khalil')

The code works fine but I got a warning like that
Demo.py:7: DeprecationWarning: executable_path has been deprecated, please pass in a Service object
driver = webdriver.Chrome(ChromeDriverManager().install())

How to fix such a bug?
"	"
This error message...
DeprecationWarning: executable_path has been deprecated, please pass in a Service object

...implies that the key executable_path will be deprecated in the upcoming releases.
This change is inline with the Selenium 4.0 Beta 1 changelog which mentions:

Deprecate all but Options and Service arguments in driver instantiation. (#9125,#9128)


Solution
With selenium4 as the key executable_path is deprecated you have to use an instance of the Service() class along with ChromeDriverManager().install() command as discussed below.
Pre-requisites
Ensure that:

Selenium is upgraded to v4.0.0
pip3 install -U selenium


Webdriver Manager for Python is installed
pip3 install webdriver-manager




You can find a detailed discussion on installing Webdriver Manager for Python in ModuleNotFoundError: No module named 'webdriver_manager' error even after installing webdrivermanager

Selenium v4 compatible Code Block
from selenium import webdriver
from selenium.webdriver.chrome.service import Service
from webdriver_manager.chrome import ChromeDriverManager

driver = webdriver.Chrome(service=Service(ChromeDriverManager().install()))
driver.get(""https://www.google.com"")

You can find a detailed discussion on installing Webdriver Manager for Python in Selenium ChromeDriver issue using Webdriver Manager for Python


Incase you want to pass the Options() object you can use:
from selenium import webdriver
from selenium.webdriver.chrome.options import Options
from selenium.webdriver.chrome.service import Service
from webdriver_manager.chrome import ChromeDriverManager

options = Options()
options.add_argument(""start-maximized"")
driver = webdriver.Chrome(service=Service(ChromeDriverManager().install()), options=options)
driver.get(""https://www.google.com"")


TL; DR
You can find the relevant Bug Report/Pull Request in:

Bug Report: deprecate all but Options and Service arguments in driver instantiation
Pull Request: deprecate all but Options and Service arguments in driver instantiation

............................................................
I could figure it out
# pip install webdriver-manager
from selenium import webdriver
from selenium.webdriver.chrome.service import Service
from webdriver_manager.chrome import ChromeDriverManager
from selenium.webdriver.common.by import By

s=Service(ChromeDriverManager().install())
driver = webdriver.Chrome(service=s)
driver.maximize_window()
driver.get('https://www.google.com')
driver.find_element(By.NAME, 'q').send_keys('Yasser Khalil')

............................................................
This works for me
from selenium import webdriver
from selenium.webdriver.chrome.service import Service
ser = Service(""C:\\chromedriver.exe"")
op = webdriver.ChromeOptions()
s = webdriver.Chrome(service=ser, options=op)

............................................................
I found this deprecation issue is appearing on Selenium, Pip and Python updates. so simply just change :
before:
from selenium import webdriver
chrome_driver_path = 'C:/Users/Morteza/Documents/Dev/chromedriver.exe'
driver = webdriver.Chrome(executable_path=chrome_driver_path)

url = ""https://www.google.com""
driver.get(url)

after:
from selenium import webdriver
from selenium.webdriver.chrome.service import Service

s=Service('C:/Users/Morteza/Documents/Dev/chromedriver.exe')
browser = webdriver.Chrome(service=s)
url='https://www.google.com'
browser.get(url)

............................................................
All the above answers refer to Chrome, adding the one for Firefox
Install:
pip install webdriver-manager

Code:
from selenium.webdriver.firefox.service import Service
from webdriver_manager.firefox import GeckoDriverManager
driver = webdriver.Firefox(service=Service(executable_path=GeckoDriverManager().install()))

Reference: https://github.com/SergeyPirogov/webdriver_manager/issues/262#issuecomment-955197860
............................................................
from selenium import webdriver
from selenium.webdriver.chrome.service import Service
service_obj = Service(""WebDrivers_path\chromedriver.exe"")
driver = webdriver.Chrome(service=service_obj)
driver.get(""https://www.google.com"")

............................................................
Simplest option with Chrome auto-installer:
from selenium import webdriver
import chromedriver_autoinstaller
from selenium.webdriver.chrome.service import Service

chromedriver_autoinstaller.install()
driver = webdriver.Chrome(service=Service())

............................................................
Have a look at the new definition in the Service object here.
My solution
from selenium.webdriver.chrome.service import Service

chrome_executable = Service(executable_path='chromedriver.exe', log_path='NUL')
driver = webdriver.Chrome(service=chrome_executable)

............................................................
if you are using any IDE like PyCharm install webdriver-manager package of that IDE as how do install for selenium package
............................................................
You can create an instance of ChromeOptions, which has convenient methods for setting ChromeDriver-specific capabilities. You can then pass the ChromeOptions object into the ChromeDriver constructor:
ChromeOptions options = new ChromeOptions();

options.addExtensions(new File(""/path/to/extension.crx""));

ChromeDriver driver = new ChromeDriver(options);

Since Selenium version 3.6.0, the ChromeOptions class in Java also implements the Capabilities interface, allowing you to specify other WebDriver capabilities not specific to ChromeDriver.
ChromeOptions options = new ChromeOptions();

// Add the WebDriver proxy capability.

Proxy proxy = new Proxy();

proxy.setHttpProxy(""myhttpproxy:3337"");

options.setCapability(""proxy"", proxy);

// Add a ChromeDriver-specific capability.

options.addExtensions(new File(""/path/to/extension.crx""));

ChromeDriver driver = new ChromeDriver(options);

All of a sudden, my Delphi 10.3 stopped showing compiler hints in some (but not all) procedures of one project (but not others - and may I add that I have far more complex ones). MadDebug stopped working with this error:

Enforcing hints with $ and un/re-installing MadCollection doesn't help.

You can change the editor font and size in the Options menu.

From Help:

Select a font type from the available screen fonts installed on your system (shown in the list). The Code Editor displays and uses only monospaced screen fonts, such as Courier.

For code, you can also use Ctrl+Num + and Ctrl+Num - to increase and decrease the font size.

I am in Delphi 10.2.2 Tokyo and trying to do a simpleregular expression search. I'm sure I've done this before but it's not working.
It doesn't work whether I Ctrl-F search in the current source file or I Ctrl-Shift-F Find in Files.
I have researched this to make sure I understood the special characters & their meanings.
Anyway, search string fun.*e I assume will find any function declaration with an e in its name.
It finds nothing! I have tried a variety of searches like this - they all are finding nothing.
Case sensitive unchecked.
Whole words unchecked.
Search selection unchecked.
Entire scope checked. (for Ctrl-F, in current source file, search)
And, of course, Regular expression checked.
If I Search in Files I get the Search string 'fun.*e' not found popup. Period.
However, if I Ctrl-F I am seeing (current unit) 31 matches found in dark green down in the ""search bar"" and if I scroll through the unit, I am seeing the matches (highlighted in orange). But the cursor does not move to the first (or any) match. If I hit F3 immediately after doing the search (and seeing 31 matches found) I am getting the Search Match Not Found Restart search from the beginning of the file? popup. And if I say Yes I am back to seeing Search string 'fun.*e' not found!
I don't know if I might've changed some setting or option or whatever. I cannot imagine that I have. But I need to use Regular Expressions for searching.
FWIW, ""normal"" searches are working fine (whether Regular expression is checked or not).

(Spyder maintainer here) You said

Unfortunately, Spyder can't do that for you at the moment.
A workaround is to mount the remote directory where you have your file locally and then open it in Spyder. For that you can use sshfs or sshfs-win, depending on your operating system.

I have been using two separate IDE's for my coursework (jGRASP and Netbeans). Whenever I attempt to save a file in Netbeans, the file automatically saves as a ""jGRASP Java file"" instead (see picture below). When I open the project from file explorer it automatically opens jGRASP instead of Netbeans, even though I saved the project while using Netbeans. Is there a way to ensure that projects I work on in Netbeans do not save as jGRASP files? When submitting my assignments, I have been instructed to ensure they are Netbeans projects (not any other IDE).

"	"
What it looks like to me, is the file association for .java files in your computer are set to use jGRASP, you should be able to just change the association in your PC and it would be fine. They are just .java files so if you submit them it should be ok, but you can change it.

This question already has answers here:





What is the purpose of the return statement? How is it different from printing?

Closed 2 months ago.





If I try the below code in command prompt , I get correct results, however, the same code using IDE(Atom) do not produce any results.
def search_for_vowels(word):
""""""Display any vowels found in an asked for word""""""
vowels = set('aeiou')
found = vowels.intersection(set(word))
return bool(found)

search_for_vowels('galaxy')

"	"
Using the command prompt to code is different than using IDE. When you use the command prompt you use something called interpreter, it will execute every line you write right after you click enter. You can write an object like that:
search_for_vowels('galaxy')

And it will print its __repr__ to the screen.
In IDE it is not the case. It won't print you the __repr__ of an object just be writing it. If you want to see the object or the function call result use print like that:
print(search_for_vowels('galaxy'))

Hoping someone might be able to assist me with this.
I've been having an issue with Visual Studio where parts of the background processes are constantly crashing and throwing exceptions.
To re-create it I just simply create a new .NET 5 console project, and open it and this is what I am greeted with:
StreamJsonRpc.RemoteInvocationException: Could not load file or assembly 'System.Threading.Tasks.Dataflow, Version=4.6.5.0, Culture=neutral, PublicKeyToken=b03f5f7f11d50a3a' or one of its dependencies. The filename, directory name, or volume label syntax is incorrect.

I get these windows appearing constantly. If I clear and rebuild solution they come back.

Q) all prime numbers can be written in the form of 6m+1 or 6m-1 for some m>=1. write a program to print ""Cannot be decided"" if the above property is fulfilled or ""Composite number"" otherwise.
I can't figure out how to put the given statement into a code. i tried a few codes (such as the one given below) but nothing is striking me. Please help. my code is in the pastebin link because formatting here isn't working properly
https://pastebin.com/sMqT6Eic
n=int(input())
for m in range(1,n):
 
if n==6*m+1 or n==6*m-1:
print(""Cannot be determined"")
else:
print(""Composite number"")
break

"	"
There is no point to having a loop, it's just unnecessary work and it's much less clear. Every prime p greater than 3 must be of the form 6m + 1 or 6m - 1 for some integer m. That's equivalent to saying that p = 1 mod 6 or p = -1 = 5 mod 6. So just make that the test.
n=int(input('Enter value to test for primality: '))

# assume n > 3

if n % 6 in (1, 5):
print(""Cannot be determined"")
else:
print(""Composite number"")

............................................................
There is indentation errors and also remove the ''' near the declaration of n variable. Break the loop when the condition is satisfied not outside the if statement. It will check only for m=1 and break the loop. Take a new variable that will update its value when the condition is satisfied and the loop breaks. If the variable is updated, it is prime and if variable is not updated, the condition was never satisfied and it is composite. Edited code:
n=int(input())
m=int()
f=0 #new variable
for m in range(1,n):
if n==6*m+1 or n==6*m-1:
f=1 #update the variable when condition satisfied
break #break the loop
else:
continue
if f==1: #updated value when condition satisfied
print(""Cannot be determined"")
else:

Is it even possible to change the colour theme using the CLI? I went through the doc but could not find anything that matches this requirement.
I am working on a personal project where I am adding a cron job to switch the theme of my computer.
"	"
It's not possible to change settings using the code command, but instead you could use sed to edit settings.json like so:
sed -i -e 's/""workbench.colorTheme"": "".*""/""workbench.colorTheme"": ""Visual Studio Dark""/g' ""$HOME/.config/Code/User/settings.json""


""workbench.colorTheme"": "".*"" is the regular expression (regex) to replace.
""workbench.colorTheme"": ""Visual Studio Dark"" is the replacement string. Change Visual Studio Dark to your desired theme.
$HOME/.config/Code/User/settings.json is the path to your settings.json

This is a case of not being able to look something up because I don't know the name for it. In many code editors you can include these in the preceding comment block of a definition and then get helpful mouse-over text elsewhere, or other programs can read these comments and do something useful with them. I'm working on a file related to Doxygen. For example:
/// AskStackOverflow() - Gets answer to a question
/// @name AskStackOverflow
/// @brief Ask Stack Overflow
/// @param q Question to be asked 
/// @return Number of up votes for this cheeky comment
int AskStackOverFlow(std::string q)

When in a class there is the ability to autocomplete certain methods, e.g. the constructor or some inherited functions. I'd like to add some custom methods like public function foo():void to the autocomplete if a specific trait is applied. First I thought of Live Templates but they cannot be constrained to be only applied if there is a certain trait present.
Do you have any idea how I could achieve this? Maybe by generating some docblocks?

You can use @method tag in PHPDoc comment for the trait to declare such ""virtual"" methods. Modern PhpStorm versions can offer such signature when invoking code completion when declaring a new method.
<?php

When I open the Eclipse IDE the window titles don't show text properly, not all but most texts related to the IDE are jagged and glitchy, anyone knows what might be the issue?
Things I have tried:

Restarted Eclipse multiple times (both closing and opening, and also; File -> Restart)
Changed the fonts
Updated the IDE and everything within it to the latest version:
Version: 2021-03 (4.19.0)
Build id: 20210312-0638
OS: Windows 10, v.10.0, x86_64 / win32
Java version: 15.0.1
Changed the appearance(s)
Changed the encoding(s)
Restarted the computer
Also I'm using the Windows 10, and OS and Drivers are updated to the latest version at the time of posting this problem
I searched in/with Google, Stackoverflow, and other search engines with different wording, and all there was were issues with in-editor text rendering/formatting (As you can see in the picture other texts appear fine, like the project itself)

P.S. I don't have the issue with other IDEs I use; like Android Studio (IntelliJ), although I've seen the same issue on Android Studio which used to get fixed with a simple restart, which later they patched the bug as well, so idk if I'm missing something or not, any help would be appreciated

"	"
Ok, I've found a solution or a way around it, I now am pretty sure it is an IDE's bug
It seems to be a problem with the theming option, what I did was changing the themes to see whether it's gonna get fixed or not, and what I missed was I didn't check all the themes! One appears to be fixing the issue and that is the ""Classic"" theme only, the only one that works currently
Here's where to find it:
Window -> Preferences -> General -> Appearance -> Theme (dropdown menu) -> Classic
Note: Even disabling theming won't fix the problem for some reason, only selecting ""Classic"" seems to be working at the moment, hopefully they will fix it soon

Is there any way to make the editor recognize the comments of manifest.json?

This is very simple component I built throughout the course I take (Recently I've started learning React). This ""error"" only occures when I add a dollar sign inside a <div></div> in combination with {}. Since the code runs without any errors in the Node.js environment, why is my IDE behaving that strangely? I think there might be something wrong with the settings, but it's only my assumption.

In .xml on the top right corner, you can find design and code options, and if you want drag and drop feature you can choose design and you can add features by simply drag and drop. If you want any default template you can choose while creating a project or while creating new activity.

I am attempting to develop a Wear OS app which is dependent on a paired Android phone to perform some higher complexity computations.To this end I have implemented on the wearable side the proper infrastructure to pass a PutDataMapRequest message to the phone app, where I am having trouble is extending the WearableListenerService class on the phone side.When I alt+enter to see the suggested actions menu, the option to add the requisite library is there.However when I select that option nothing happens and the option is still there afterwards (the error is not rectified).I will caveat this by saying I have only been developing for Android for about 2 weeks so some of this Android Studio and its' quirks are still a little new to me.Prior to this point I had attempted various incarnations of building this app.The first where I had built the apps separately, and on that attempt this same extension caused problems (the IDE didn't even offer any suggestions at that point).I also tried loading the data layer api sample to find an example of the wearable listener service but unfortunately it is only present on the wear side of the app.The original source of this approach was from this tutorial, which I know is a little old at this point (at least one of the calls on the wear side are deprecated which I already worked around).At about 2:00 in the presenter is able to extend WearableListenerService without any issue within his phone side app and I have no idea what I am missing to be able to do that.I also did look into just trying to add the support library manually but to no avail.

Ok so, for anyone who runs into a similar issue down the road.The solution appears to be that when you create a wearable app through the new wizard and attempt to add an application module to the project, you will need to manually add the following lines to your phone app side gradle file under dependencies.
implementation 'com.google.android.gms:play-services-wearable:17.1.0'
implementation 'androidx.wear:wear:1.1.0'

This allowed the IDE to recognize the requisite classes and import them accordingly into the companion phone side application.

I decided to completely uninstall android studio to fix problem related with emulator and I have followed the steps on this answer, and after I downloaded the last version when I installed it I see this screen


android studio see's that an SDK files installed on my device although everything related to the old installation of the program has been deleted, now I need to force AS to download the android SDK again, but I need to know Why it's show there's a remines of old install, and How to fix that

Update 01

After multiple uninstall and reinstalling android studio and all my tries fails to do a fresh install of it with new sdk and tools, I decided to reset my windows system and installed the fresh copy of it but I shocked when I see that the new installed also getting the same error, the AS see that there's installed SDK on my partition even though it's a completely new copy installation of windows, I wondering if the AS keep some hidden/temp files on other partition disk and this casue the problem?!
Update 02
I reported this issue to google and it looks it's a general issue, the bug assigned to someone, please star it to attract more attention and quickly solve it
"	"
I had the same problem even on the latest version of Android studio (Arctic Fox). I even tried to reinstall my Windows but it didn't work. Finally, I figured out my problem is related to the Windows date & time format. I changed it back to ""English (United States)"" from ""Control Panel\Clock and Region\Change date, time, or number formats"" and my problem was solved!
............................................................
Delete everything first, everything in the user is in the Google file,
there are files for Android, delete them, the old Sdk and the program
C:\Users\<your user>\AppData\Local\Google

C:\Users\<your user>\AppData\Roaming\Google

Now go to the Android page to download the Android, but the older version is from the archive
See the Android Studio release notes.
More downloads are available in the download archives.
And click on download from the archive or go to the direct link
https://developer.android.com/studio/archive
Then look for the version Android Studio 3.6.3 April 17, 2020
Then click on it and download the appropriate version for your system
Now after the normal install
Download all the appropriate emulators and operating systems for you and all the tools you need
And in the end, go to updates and then to check update
To download the

latest version of Android 4.2.1

The problem returns,
but you will now have the required emulators, SDK tools and everything you need.
............................................................

Uninstall Android Studio
Delete folder '.android' in C:\Users""username""\
Delete folders 'Android and Android Open Source Project' in C:\Users""username""\AppData\Local\
Now install Android Studio and it should work

............................................................
Step 2 and 3 if you have not already done them after reinstalling Windows

Close Android Studio (and completely uninstall) and Clear temp files from your System. (press windows+r and search for temp and %temp% folder turn by turn and delete all the files in those folders which you are able to delete). Temp files might be the reason it detects the remains of older install.

Download and Install the JDK from here (you can uninstall any previously installed SDK if you want but it is not necessary).

Add the installed JDK to path as System Variables. (Adding to path makes the application automatically accessible to everything running on your OS, this way android studio will automatically detect it). If you do not know how to add JDK to path or verify if it was successfully added watch this tiny video.

Restart the PC

Install and Start the Android Studio (as Administrator) and it should detect the new SDK (it comes with the 933mb android studio you downloaded) automatically but if it does not, refer to the path User/AppData/Local/Android/Sdk. Many a times just running as administrator solves these kind of problems.




and no there will be no hidden files on the other disk partition
and there is never a need to reinstall the OS
as for the reason why this bug occurred it might be the temp files but it is very difficult to point out exactly without being actually present at your computer.

............................................................
I faced a similar issue but on my case I installed android studio before I installed the java JDK. After installing JDK it prompted me the android SDK was missing and android studio installed it itself.

I use several associative arrays in my PHP application and I'm using PHP documentor to comment my sources. I never really did specify comments for the arrays in an array, but now I need to do that and don't know how.

$array = array('id' => 'test', 'class' => 'tester', 'options' => array('option1' => 1, 'option2' => 2))


How do I comment this array in the correct way for @var and @param comments?
I could do this like this, but I don't know if this is correct:

@param string $array['id']
@param string $array['class']
@param int $array['options']['option1']


But how to do this for the @var part?
"	"
You can't document each key, but you can tell phpDocumentor what type it is.

You could do something like this:

/**
 * Form the array like this:
 * <code>
 * $array = array(
 * 'id'=> 'foo',// the id
 * 'class' => 'myClass', // the class
 * );
 * 
 * </code>
 *
 * @var array[string]string 
 */
$array;

............................................................
I would look at the WordPress Inline Documentation Reference for some hints, though it's not currently comprehensive.

Use @param or @var or @property, whichever is appropriate in your context

According to those guidelines, you might document your associative array like this:

/**
 * @property array $my_array {
 * An array of parameters that customize the way the parser works.
 *
 * @type boolean $ignore_whitespace Whether to gobble up whitespace. Default true.
 * @type string $error_level What the error reporting level is. Default 'none'.
 * Accepts 'none', 'low', 'high'.
 * }
 */

............................................................
For me this works fine in PhpStorm for nice return value description:

/**
 * @param string $requestUri
 * @return array[
 *'controller' => string,
 *'action' => string
 * ]
 */

I'm looking for a solution, with it i can mark a selector in my scss files as deprecated. Then if i working on a html file and the same time want to use this ""deprecated-selector"" my IDE should mark the selector and should show a deprecation message to me. I would like to have something similar:
/**
 * @deprecated Please use '.ui-fresh__selector' instead!
 */
.ui-old__selector {...}

...as like with JSDoc we do. It would be also fine to achieve this with .editorconfig or with some linting tool. For example, it would be great if I could set an array in the configuration file, with all of those deprecated selectors...or something like this? ðŸ¤” It would be also important to showing those deprecation message in the IDE, and not only later in the build/compiling phase. It's look like pretty hard to find a proper solution for it.
Any suggestions are welcome! Thanks Guys!
"	"
Those things fall into the realm of linters. I don't know anything about the capabilities of html linters. But you still would have another problem: in many cases the classname is only formed when the SASS is compiled to CSS.
/**
 * @deprecated Please use '.ui-fresh__selector' instead!
 */
.ui-old {
&__selector {}
}

.ui-fresh {
&__selector {}
}

But what you can do is you can create a deprecation warning that shows up (when rendered) around all elements that use the old style. You can configure your webpack (or whatever bundler you use) to only include the deprecation warning when it is a DEV build, but never in a PROD build.
@import ""deprecation"";

/**
 * @deprecated Please use '.ui-fresh__selector' instead!
 */
.ui-old {
@include deprecated;
&__selector {}
}

.ui-fresh {
&__selector {}
}

and
// _deprecation.scss
@mixin deprecated {
@if $env == development {
border: 4px solid red !important;
}
}

the $env variable can be set in your webpack config via the sass-loader option additionalData
{
loader: 'sass-loader',
options: {
additionalData: '$env: ' + process.env.NODE_ENV + ';'
},
},

............................................................

I usually start building up code in a jupyter notebook, and then make that into a function/ class that I drop in multiple files. To access/ edit those files I used Xcode. Whereas this works more or less ok, it does require to reload the classes/ functions on the jupyter notebook every time I make a change and having to use two different softwares to code seems unsatisfying. What is the optimal way of going about this?

Have you tried PyCharm? It comes with an extension that runs Jupyter inside the IDE.

I recently finished with PSET9 and wanted to transition from CS50 IDE to VS Code for the Final Project. Problem is I don't know what exactly I need to set up to make it all work. I guessed that I just need to import the CS50 library, which I then did following me checking out their GitHub. I did as instructed pip3 install cs50. However, even though various files were installed, my application.py is still saying that it can't find any modules, see screenshot. Why is that? What do I need to do?
Also what might I still be missing after having resolved this? Do I still need to do something to fully have the CS50 IDE essentially running on the VS Code (server, databases, etc)?

I think you need to create virtual environment for that and then activate it.
Create virtual environment in command line Windows

go to you root app folder.
python3 -m venv env (type this command in terminal)
for activate env type this in windows (env\scripts\activate)
for apple and linux type this in terminal) source env/bin/activate

then use pip install
............................................................
First thing to do is just make sure you've got those items installed correctly by using these commands in your terminal:
pip show cs50
flask --version
werkzeug --version

If they're installed, but you haven't quit and restarted VS Code, try that.
If you're using a virtual environment, make sure you reactivate it before trying to run your application.
I hope one of these helps solve your problem!

I recently installed Qt, actually I am developing a C++ project which was written to comply with Qt 5.15.2, so I downloaded that one, and installed Creator 8.0.1 (Enterprise) too. Creator does not start, but it welcomes me with this message:

The application failed to start because no Qt platform plugin could be
initialized. Reinstalling the application may fix this problem.
Available platform plugins are: direct2d, minimal, offscreen, windows.

I already tried with reinstalling related Qt components, it does not help. Also, I installed Qt Creator 9.0.0-beta1, but that gives the exact same error message.
I tried to google the error message to get an answer, but eveywhere (e.g. https://ugetfix.com/ask/how-to-fix-application-failed-to-start-because-no-qt-platform-plugin-could-be-initialized-error-in-windows/) they say I should search for some kind of ""pyqt5_tools"" folder, and copy the contents of a subdirectory inside Python install directory on my computer into a subdirectory in that folder... but I do not have Python on my computer, and it has nothing to do my project or anything. The project I am working on is in C++, and I would only like to use the Qt Creator application for that. Should I download Python or something for this? How exactly is Python related to Qt Creator at all?
(Anyway, Qt itself works fine, I can develop my code using VSCode and Qt libraries, build and debug them, but I would like to use Creator as an IDE because for certain things it is easier for a Qt app development.)
My machine is nice and new, just freshly reinstalled it a few months ago, 480GB SSD as main drive, 8GB RAM, Intel i7-2820QM CPU. I am using Windows 8.1 Pro with all latest updates.
I appreciate any help. Thanks in advance!
"	"
QtCreator 8.0.1 does not support Windows 8.1 (because it is developed in Qt 6, which supports only Windows 10 and newer, see https://doc.qt.io/qt-6/supported-platforms.html).
You will probably need to download and install older versions of QtCreator. You can find some of them here https://download.qt.io/archive/qtcreator/
Alternatively you should upgrade to Windows 10, which is definitely a more future-proof solution for you...

I am using different IDEs for different languages in different PCs. I want to use Git for syncs projects PC to PC. Is default IDE important for use git? Or it doesnt matter for usage?
"	"
Depends on what IDEs you mean. In general it's not important because Git is just a version control system and it will save what code you upload. Note that Git can also be used locally. You don't need GitHub or some other services to have a git repository.
There are some things that are better with the same IDE.
IDE's like IntelliJ etc. have an Auto Formatter, which may conflict with other Auto Formatters like Visual Studio Code's.
These conflicts are not breaking your code, but it will produce a lot of changes in files as you are opening them in different IDEs and will run the Auto Formatter.
For example: You change 3 Lines of Code, but the whole file got auto formatted by another IDE and the total changes are 200 Lines.

I would like to set up VIM for Cobol development and wanted to have the lines form column 7 to 11 marked so as to indicate the code areas. However, when I added this line of code in my vimrc file it colorized the NERDTree too.
set colorcolumn=7,11,73,80
autocmd VimEnter * NERDTree
autocmd VimEnter * wincmd p

How can I make the NERDTree columns not colorized and keep colorization only on the working file?

"	"
With the following line in your vimrc:
set colorcolumn=7,11,73,80

you define a global value for a window-local option which is reused for every new window. It is set for the 1st window, which passes it on to the 2nd window, etc.
Since that specific value for that specific option only is to be applied to Cobol buffers, you are supposed to use Vim's built-in filetype plugin support:

Make sure you have either of those lines in your vimrc:
filetype plugin on
filetype plugin indent on
filetype indent plugin on

See :help :filetype.

Create after/ftplugin/cobol.vim under your Vim runtime. On a typical Unix system, it should look like this:
$HOME/.vim/after/ftplugin/cobol.vim


And add the line below:
setlocal colorcolumn=7,11,73,80

We use :help :setlocal to make sure that the option won't be passed on to other windows.

How do I disable it properly?
"	"
Metals contributor here ðŸ‘‹.
The feature you're seeing is generically caled hover and it's the result of Metals implementing the textDocument/hover request as specified by LSP.
Some editors, like VSCode, trigger that request when the mouse hovers on a piece of text, and - if the server responds - they show a popup with the content of the response.
You can control this behavior in VSCode by using the editor.hover.enabled setting.
For example, if you set it to false then you won't get popups on hover anymore, and you will need to manually trigger them. The default keybinding for this should be CTRL K CTRL I (i.e. keep CTRL pressed and hit K followed by I).
............................................................
It seems that bloop is responsible for this popup, it doesn't look like a function parameter popup. That means that there might be another setting besides â€œeditor.parameterHints.enableâ€?in one of your scala related extensions.
For example Scala (Metals) extension offers a hover, but there isn't a setting to turn it off, as far as I can tell:

can someone help me capitalize the ""Y"" in years thats the only error I have right now thanks.

key_holiday.to_s.split(""_"").map(&:capitalize).join("" "")

since you want to capitalize each word, use map to modify the array [""new"", ""year""] to [""New"", ""Year""] then join the words with a space.
............................................................
On top of Yoav Epstein's comment,
if you are trying to get the mentioned functionality on Rails, you can use titleize function.
pry(main)> ""new year: Party HATS"".titleize
=> ""New Year: Party Hats""

.upcase instead of .capitalize should get you caps capitalize only uppercases the first character, upcase will get the whole thing

I have developed a IDE for a custom language in Eclipse 3 for RCP and RAP developers. Therefore I used IDE plug-ins wherever possible and applicable. This week I was busy migrating the application to Eclipse e4 (with compatibility layer) with Eclipse for RCP and RAP developers 2021-6. Everything works nearly fine so far.
The one thing i cannot figure out is how I can place the ""run"" menu where I want. It is placed as first menu in the menu bar.
Another strange thing by the way is that if I use Eclipse 2020-6 instead of 2021-6 as development environment, also the search menu is at the wrong position.
The problem is that the run and search menus come from an IDE plug-in and they are implemented as actions and therefore I cannot specify any order in terms of menus. For all other menus I defined appropriate menuContibutions, commands and handlers. For the latter, I can decide where each menu should be placed with the help of plugin.xml by specifying ?before= or ?after=.
I did a search over stackoverflow issues that have to do with adding menus, reorderung menus, mixing actions with commands and handlers and so on but I could not find a solution how I could place the run menu where I want.
I hoped that there would be something like an ID that I can use to specify as ?before= or ?after= in plugin.xml but I think this will not work with actions.
Can anyone give me a hint how I could place all menus in the desired order? Or is this simply impossible when mixing actions and commands+handlers? Is there any actions-wrapping functionality in order for me to specify ?before= or ?after= in my menuContibutions in plugin.xml?
"	"
If you mean the Run menu added by the org.eclipse.debug.ui plug-in this is created using and action set:
 <extension point=""org.eclipse.ui.actionSets"">
<actionSet
label=""%BreakpointActionSet.label""
visible=""false""
id=""org.eclipse.debug.ui.breakpointActionSet"">
 <menu
 label=""%RunMenu.label""
 path=""additions""
 id=""org.eclipse.ui.run"">

which is adding the Run menu at the position additions in the main menu.
The standard main menu created by org.eclipse.ui.internal.ide.WorkbenchActionBuilder creates the main menu like this:
@Override
protected void fillMenuBar(IMenuManager menuBar) {
menuBar.add(createFileMenu());
menuBar.add(createEditMenu());
menuBar.add(createNavigateMenu());
menuBar.add(createProjectMenu());

// This line creates the 'additions' position
menuBar.add(new GroupMarker(IWorkbenchActionConstants.MB_ADDITIONS));

menuBar.add(createWindowMenu());
menuBar.add(createHelpMenu());
}

I use clang-format to format the following code, but the effect is not what I want:

{

Is there any options to make clang-format produce the following effect?
void f(int, int, std::vector<int>, std::map<int, int>)
{}

int main()
{
f({}, 
{}, 
{1, 2, 3},
{
{1, 2},
{3, 4},
});

Yes there is, use the style you want. (it's really that easy!)
clang-format -h tells you about the available options that clang-format has.

--style=<string> - Coding style, currently supports:
 LLVM, GNU, Google, Chromium, Microsoft, Mozilla, WebKit.
 Use -style=file to load style configuration from
 .clang-format file located in one of the parent
 directories of the source file (or current
 directory for stdin).


In your case, you probably want something like clang-format --style=LLVM.
But it's not going to be exactly what you want. So, you'll need to write your own style file. It's not that hard. Use clang-format --style=file and put the style definitions in a file called .clang-format in the same, or one of its parent directories.
The documentation explains exactly what you need to do. If you're more of the visual type, this generator might be helpful.
Note, though, that you're probably better off making only minor adjustments to a ""common"" base style; other programmers might not like it when you do wildly different than other code they're used to. For an example of a modified-as-far-as-necessary-to-deal-with-specific-project-needs style file, see GNU Radio's .clang-format file.

How to catch coordinates of mouse cursor (IDE Delphi) when I invoke Context Menu to create a new control?
I'd like to create a new control via Context Menu at same coordinates where Context Menu was invoked.
I'm creating my own component editor to do this, then I need the coordinates of mouse to create the control there.
"	"
I don't know if I understood your question well, but there are some ways to capture position of your mouse:
Method 1 - Capture the mouse position on your screen:
Here you can use TMouse class like this:
var
m: TMouse;
begin
lbl_cordinate_screen.Caption := format('Mouse cordinate on screen: x:%d, y:%d', 
[m.CursorPos.X, m.CursorPos.y]);
end;

Method 2 - Capture the mouse position on a control:
Here you can use GetCursorPos, I declared a function called cursorCordinate, it will receive a control name (I used my form named frm_main as given control but it can be any other control like a button, label or anything else) and it will return a TPoint value containing position of mouse on given control:
//function to capture mouse position on a control
function cursorCordinate(myCtrl: TWinControl): TPoint;
var
mouse_p: TPoint;
begin
GetCursorPos(mouse_p);
ScreenToClient(myCtrl.Handle, mouse_p );
result := mouse_p;
end;

usage example:
begin
lbl_cordinate_form_1.Caption := format('Mouse cordinate on form: x:%d, y:%d',
[cursorCordinate(frm_main).X, cursorCordinate(frm_main).y]);
end;

Method 3 - Another way to capture the mouse position on a control:
Here you can use control's OnMouseMove event and its X and Y parameters, just place your code block in this event. I used it to show mouse position on my form (frm_main) in a label (lbl_cordinate_form_2), but you can use any other control's OnMouseMove event:
procedure Tfrm_main.FormMouseMove(Sender: TObject; Shift: TShiftState; X,
Y: Integer);
begin
lbl_cordinate_form_2.Caption := format('Mouse cordinate on form: x:%d, y:%d', [x, y]);
end;

You can see the result in image; first line is result of Method 1, second line for Method 2 and third line belongs to Method 3:

............................................................
By add this cod to FormContextPopup can obtain mouse position
 uses FMX.Forms;
 ...
 ...
 procedure TForm88.FormContextPopup(Sender: TObject; MousePos: TPoint;
var Handled: Boolean);
begin
Label1.Caption:=FMX.Forms.Screen.MousePos.X.ToString+' 
 '+FMX.Forms.Screen.MousePos.Y.ToString;

end;

Does PyCharm have a history of the tests which I executed during the last hours?

Background:

I start insisde test_big_foo() for method big_foo() and notice that a helper method needs to updated.

I update helper_method() and update its unittest test_helper_method().

This takes some time.

Now I want to pop one item of my workstack.

That's why I would like to see the history of the tests in PyCharm.

My next action would be to rerun test_big_foo().
"	"
You can use a Pin tab feature of PyCharm: right click on the tab or click to the button. After that this tab will stay, so you can see what have been executed.

Other way to do that is clicking on Import Test Resultsbutton, which would give you possibility to switch to recent test executions:

You can enable logging for console output. Configure it from Run/Debug configurations. Check the option which says Save console output to a file.

There you can select the last tests you run.

I think this list is too short, but it's better than nothing.

I am very new to OMNeT++ and probably I miss something basic.
I use OMNeT++ IDE. When I run omnetpp.ini as OMNeT++ Simulation I get the error
<!> Error: Cannot load library '../../src//libveins.dll': The specified procedure could not be found
which is self explanatory. My problem is that the file libveins.dll is indeed located in src folder and I do not understand why it cannot be found (see picture below)

I was browsing in the files trying to track where the error is coming from, but I did not find the place where libveins.dll would be loaded.
Does anybody know how to solve the issue?
"	"
I think this error might be due to more than one factor so you should provide more information.
I had something similar while using incompatible versions of Omnetpp and Veins. Maybe you'd want to share your host system and the versions you're using. For me was enough to test different versions of the program and the frameworks. Also import/reference one framework at a time, so you know if it's a compatibility fault. E.g. I could not use veins and inet at same time for some reason.
Another hint: From your screenshot I see a red cross on the ""subprojects"" folder so maybe you set that as a NED source file directory? Make sure these boxes are selected.

Problem was solved after a reboot. I think it was a pending windows update who caused this .

I am trying to write a python-script to work with dataframes imported from excel table and another one from another source. In order to read excel file into a pandas dataframe i selected ""openpyxl"" as a preferred engine, however PyCharm claims there is no such module - even though I have earlier installed it.
I am working on conda and i tried to install it both using pycharm terminal and my macbook terminal: when i retype ""conda install openpyxl"" it returns me

So please help me because it confuses me that PyCharm keeps screaming
""ImportError: Missing optional dependency 'openpyxl'.Use pip or conda to install openpyxl.""

while terminal says i already have that module installed

This may happen because your pycharm is using a different interpreter than your command line.
To solve it:
In Pycharm, go to File, settings, project Interpreter, in the right top corner click the + button. Search for openpyxl and click Install package to install the latest version of the package.

I'm working in an Angular project.When I create a simple HTML template like:

VS Code adds a semicolon to the end of the line when saving, which is obviously not desired.when you delete and save again it adds it back in.

Solution 1

You can do a save without formatting using Ctrl+kCtrl+Shift+S. Again, this will be a temporary solution.
Solution 2.0

You should check for plugins that you have added and remove them to make the VSCode save functionality work as expected.
Solution 2.1

Press CTRL+SHIFT+P, type ""Formatter"" and you should see an option that says Formatter Config.
After selecting that option, a file named formatter.json opens and all you do is edit the property (named onSave) from having true to being false.
Restart VSCode and it should have stopped auto-formatting.

I did not have the exact same issue, but some people may stumble across this with the same issue I had.
TLDR; I am an idiot; I was using the incorrect syntax.
This was my code:
<ul class=""contents__items"">
<li *ngFor=""let list in shoppingLists"">{{ list.name }}</li>

When I would save in VS Code, VS Code would add a colon an semicolon in like so:
<ul class=""contents__items"">
<li *ngFor=""let: list: in; shoppingLists"">{{ list.name }}</li>
</ul>

This is because I was using the keyword in instead of of. Changing this to the correct syntax corrected all the issues.

With the C standard library stdio.h, I read that to output ASCII/text data, one should use mode ""w"" and to output binary data, one should use ""wb"". But why the difference?

In either case, I'm just outputting a byte (char) array, right? And if I output a non-ASCII byte in ASCII mode, the program still outputs the correct byte.
"	"
Some operating systems - mostly named ""windows"" - don't guarantee that they will read and write ascii to files exactly the way you pass it in. So on windows they actually map \r\n to \n. This is fine and transparent when reading and writing ascii. But it would trash a stream of binary data. Basically just always give windows the 'b' flag if you want it to faithfully read and write data to files exactly the way you passed it in.
............................................................
There are certain transformations that can take place when outputting in ASCII (e.g. outputting neline+carriage-return when the outputted character is new-line) -- depending on your platform.Such transformations will not take place when using binary format

I'm sure this is a crazily easy thing to solve, and I'm doing something really basic wrong but I can't figure it out. It's also a tricky one to explain.
This is an issue only in the new google apps script environment. Switching to the legacy editor is fine.
I can't type new characters (letters, numbers, symbols, spacebar etc) inside certain parts of existing functions. But I can delete characters or add new line using the return key.
BUT I can type in other places in the same function. It's bizarre.

I've attached an image illustrating this for one of the functions. It's not just happening in that function though, it's happening on a few functions, with no apparent pattern.
I'm using Chrome on Mac OS 10.14.6
I'm sure I'm being silly. I've just been switching back to the legacy editor for months because I couldn't find anyone with the same problem and I felt too stupid to ask!
EDIT: I've just tried this using Safari and everything is fine. I guess it's a Chrome bug. However this has been happening on Chrome for months now and I've had plenty of updates. :/

If we write printf then we will automatically get â€?)â€?But why does semicolon not appear with it. I think it would solve a lot of errors.
For printf we get
printf()
We should get
printf();
"	"
So that's a good suggestion, but often there might be such functions or objects (from the OOP concept) which might have another function following it.
Example (in Javascript):
const ref = firestore.collection(db).get(); // get() fn alone

const ref = firestore.collection(db).get().then();// get() fn followed by then()

Or there can be a character at the end of the line.
Example:
for(int i=0; i<5; i++){ // '{' present. ';' will cause error
 printf(""Hi"");// ';' required
} // '}' present. ';' will cause error

So it's a much more efficient approach to just throw an error every time the compiler detects a missing semicolon. Also, when you use languages such as Python or frameworks/libraries such as Node.JS or React.JS, you won't be required to use a semicolon altogether.

Currently I build the file using this tasks and then switch to terminal and run the file. This workflow is ok, but had this been achieved, I would have been able to do build and run as supported in common IDEs. Is there a way to achieve this?

I've recently stumbled upon an issue where IntelliJ PyCharm PE started auto-optimizing my imports, but I never enabled/installed such feature, however I do have isort installed, I don't remember it having an option for auto-optimization though. Does anyone have any idea how to fix this?
Example:
I am looking at the code:
from here import this
from here2 import this2
from here1 import this1

And when I'm doing a commit stage via (Alt+0) PyCharm's commit interface it autoformats these imports to this:
from here import this
from here1 import this1
from here2 import this2

I am playing around with a python software-like code that I downloaded. I need to extract some parts of the code and so I am currently tracing it to understand it better. It would make my life much easier to trace the code in an IDE (I use spyder) so that I can put breakpoints and visually inspect the variables. I therefore want to modify the code but I don't know how to proceed.
This is the directory structure of the code. The main directory is ""advance"" and 2 of its subdirectories are ""advance"" and ""examples"". The code was installed using pip and to run the code, one must go to the examples directory, enter a sub-directory which represents a test case, and simply type ""advance ."" in the terminal (the ""."" represents pwd).
After some tracing, I found out that doing this calls the file driver.py with address advance/advance/driver.py. The driver.py code has the structure below:
# import stuff here

def main():

parser = argparse.ArgumentParser(description=""Read working directory"")

# some stuff here


if __name__ == ""__main__"":
try:
main()
except:
print(traceback.format_exc())
print(""Execution failed"")

As you can see, the main function takes an input which is the working directory.
My question now is: How can I modify this so that I can run this code in my IDE? Or better yet, can I write a script that calls the main function in driver.py and give it the path of the directory for the example test case I want to run? If so, how can I do it?
Thanks and apologies if it sounds too simple. I am coming from Matlab and transitioning to python.

I found in this reddit post that spyder offers to pass command line options, when running a script. See the following setting:
Run -> Configure -> Command line options

Unfortunately, I am not familiar with Spyder, so that's what I can tell so far. I guess it works similar to PyCharm (which I use). There it is like this: You adapt your run configuration and can set the parameters you want to pass a script. Afterwards, when running that run configuration PyCharm will always pass those particular parameters to the script. This allows to use the IDE's debugger to examine the code. I would bet that Spyder behaves almost the same way. Good luck trying the suggested settings :)

Syncing Settings Across VS Code & VS 2022

I think I have a pretty good idea of what you're asking for, and I would say that they don't have what you are thinking to have. Like, if you wonder that since they are both funded by Microsoft dollars, that there maybe some sort of interoperability, but there's not. Many people have have been hoping for some time to see Visual Studio work in harmony with V.S. Code, but I don't think that will ever happen like many people are hoping it will. The reason is, they are fundamentally â€?at the very core of what they are â€?very different beasts. While, as I pointed out, they are both developed by Microsoft dollars, and theyare both ""Development Environments"", they are not both ""Integrated Environments"", and there in lies the difference that makes them worlds apart.
Visual Studio (the IDE) is considered to be an IDE â€?integrated is the keyword here â€?because it integrates into the projects that are built using Visual Studio as the Development Environment. Visual Studio Code does not integrate into projects, instead it allows you to structure the project, provide the compiler, debugger, and things like a build system, RTE, REPL, libraries, modules, plugins, the Languages themselves, etc... You are the master of your own environment with V.S. Code, and where developers have much more control over their projects using a non-integrated dev-env, especially one that's non-proprietary, they also have to put in much more work, to produce many of the same programs that Visual Studio can practically generate for you.
So the point here is, that you can't really swap configurations between the two, not for the majority of configured stuff, however; that's not to say that some settings cannot not be swapped. Any configuration that can have the same values applied to it, whether the configuration is in VS Code, or Visual Studio 2022, would not be unique to Visual Studio, and VS Code, and has nothing to do with the fact that they are both backed by Microsoft. In fact, if you have a group of settings, and those settings exist in both environments, and are able to accept all the same values (they can't accept any different values in any env) then that configuration will port to environments far beyond Visual Studio Code & Visual Studio 2022, and will probably be configurable in over 90% of the Development Environments out there. And this is something that software engineers, programmers & web-developers/designers take advantage of already, and it's referred to by its filename...

Dot-Editor-Config or .editorconfig

""Above is the Dot-Editor-Config Project's Logo.""

EditorConfig, is a good gig, but it won't configure entire environments. Like most tools, the more you use it, the better you will get at making use of it. It seems to me that it is more useful across IDE's, as IDEs, as I explained above, work similarly(obviously), so they have more settings in common. Editor config basically creates a medium for setting semantics. Since settings found in different Development Environments are often called something different in each environment, what the .editorconfig file does, is it gives a single name for each of the variation of the setting that ports across environments, and gives a single place to configure the setting, allowing you to take one file from IDE to IDE. Like I said though, there is only so much it will configure, and it works better between IDE's than between IDE and Editor, at least IMHO.
Check Editor Config out, and see what you think.
I used to use it mainly to configure formatting across C++ projects, but CLang's CLang-Format Tool has become such a good tool that I did away with it.
This link will take you to the Dot-Editor-Config GitHub Repository, where you can find the .editorconfig extensions for...

VS Code

Visual Studio

JetBrains

Emacs

Vim


...and probably many more.

I did some research, or lack-of I should say, after authoring this. I couldn't find any other options out there. There really isn't a lot in the way to help in porting configurations, except for .editorconfig, and really .editorconfig won't do much between an IDE & Editor than configure formatting styles. You can get that same functionality with Prettier, CLang, ESLint, and many other tools. Editor-config doesn't just configure its-self though, like a formatter does, so I am sure you can find some extras it targets, but It's not so much that I use it. A lot of people do, though.

If the installer program fails for you, you can always download zip package
https://www.eclipse.org/downloads/packages/release/2021-03/r
There's the installer link on top, but below that, there are links to zipped releases.
Download one of these, unzip it anywhere you want (for example into ""C:\Eclipse""), and add shortcut to desktop manually.

Unless I'm missing something, the App Script Editor lacks the ability to find a specific function within the project.
I'd like to be able to search for a specific function and then edit it.
Alternatively, how can I view a list of functions within my project (and which .gs file each is in)?
To be clear, I have a number of (logically named) .gs script files within my project each with a number of functions within.
"	"
This is not yet an available feature for the new Apps Script IDE - however there is already a fearure request for enabling cross-file search on Google's Issue Tracker:

Search function in Apps Script editor should allow searching of all project files, not just the currently open one.

Google prioritises feature requests by popularity, so make sure to give the issue a star on the above page to let them know this is highly requested.
In the mean time, the legacy editor still has cross-file search available, so you can use this to search in all project files at once.
............................................................
The new Monaco script editor lacks cross-file search, but the legacy script editor has this feature. So a workaround is to click Use legacy editor in the top right-hand corner and do your search there.
Click the star icon â˜?in the top left-hand corner of issue 175233560 to vote for this feature request and get notified of changes in status.
............................................................
Yes it does seem to lack that ability as far as I can see.I use control f and then just select between the different files.It keeps the search active between files. Making it possible to find strings in other files.I would prefer if it would just tell me where but I haven't identified that ability as yet.

So often in Eclipse, it wouldn't recognize new files, or certain things, and have a lot of errors in the IDE. The way I always fixed with was a simple (f5) refresh on the project to have the IDE recognize all the changes and things, + a clean to rebuild after. One instance in which I had this problem was when I would run mvn clean install from the command line, and then Eclipse would get angry that I did that, since it doesn't recognize things that just appeared. The above would fix it and synch the IDE with the project, also rebuilding too.
I am wondering what is the equivalent for Intellij? Suppose I'm getting issues due to Intellij not recognizing something new, or it has something old that is cached and is using it instead of something I implemented. What is a way to get Intellij to take a step back, and look at all the files and dependencies present, to get in synch with the project that is currently there and recognize everything. So far my limited use of Intellij has not demanded that this is a possibility, but assuming I ever get in a situation where Intellij needs to re-recognize things in my project, what would I do?
"	"
First of all mvn clean install from the command line is a different thing from IntelliJ clean install. IntelliJ used its own indexing and classpath for every project. you can see the projcet class path changes here
File > Project Structure > Module

And to clean the project with maven you can use the maven lifecycle window and right-hand sidebar of Intellij(if you can't see it then see it View -> Tool Windows -> Maven)

............................................................
If you want a complete refresh, then you should press File -> Invalidate Caches . Then check boxes and then press Invalidate and Restart. It's going to refresh all your projects though.

I am currently solving many similar tasks that use a header file written by me, in which, for example, there is a vector output operator, and so on. I would like this header to be added to each of my new projects automatically(or same setting like create from template), so that I don't have to do it manually. Is there an easy way to do this?
"	"
Create a library (could be a header-only one) that includes all those headers. And make it available through the path variable.
But you always need to add at least one include in the file in which you want to use it.

In Visual Studio 2019, with GIT source control.
As I perform various source control tasks in Visual Studio, such as creating branches, pulling and pushing changes, committing changes, etc..., I see helpful popup messages in the IDE such as:
Repository updated to commit 1234...
Repository is already up to date....
Other developers on my team get similar messages. However some of them do NOT get this popup after they pushed changes to origin:

Those developers have to go to Azure dev-ops to create the pull request, which is an annoyance.
I am trying to figure out, with no luck so far, how to get this message to appear for them. Why all the other popups appear except for this is puzzling. Anyone have any suggestions? It is so handy to have that link to take you right to the pr page!
Thanks,
Hedge
"	"
I had the same issue after I had to change my password because of the policy. I fixed it by simply logging out on visual studio & Git resource. When I logged in a create a new branch and push, the pull request link came back.
Hope this helps !

I have a Access table with records containg a lot of html code pieces. I want to create a form control to edit a retrieved piece of html codes. I know the Text Box control can be used for the job.
But I hope the Text Box control would color the html tags as in VSCode to make the editing job less painful. No control seems to be available for this.
What can I do to creat such a primitive IDE box in Access forms? Thank you!
"	"
I made a little HTML syntax highlighter for Microsoft Access TextBoxes with the Text Format property set to Rich Text (it effectively uses HTML tags to format the text despite the name Rich Text). It is also advisable to set the Enter Key Behavior to New Line in Field for a better editing experience.
My code uses a RegExp object from the Microsoft VBScript Regular Expressions 5.5 DLL. Therefore you must set a reference to it in the VBA Editor.
Create a text Changed handler for your TextBox. My TextBox is named Text1, therefore the Sub is named Text1_Change. Replace it by <your textbox name>_Change:
Private Sub Text1_Change()
Dim r As New RegExp
Dim colMatches As MatchCollection
Dim objMatch As Match
Dim oldPos As Long, oldLen As Long, i As Long, pos As Long, l2 As Long
Dim s As String, s1 As String, s2 As String, s3 As String, special As String
Dim specialOffset As Long

s = Replace(PlainText(Text1.Text), "" "", ""&nbsp;"")
With r
.Pattern = ""<[?!]?[^>/]+/?>|</\w+>""
.IgnoreCase = True
.Global = True
.Multiline = False
Set colMatches = .Execute(s)
End With
oldPos = Text1.SelStart
oldLen = Text1.SelLength
For i = colMatches.Count - 1 To 0 Step -1
Set objMatch = colMatches(i)
special = Mid$(objMatch.Value, 2, 1)
specialOffset = IIf(special = ""/"" Or special = ""?"" Or special = ""!"", 1, 0)
If specialOffset = 0 Then
special = """"
End If
s1 = Left$(s, objMatch.FirstIndex) & ""<font color=blue>&lt;"" & special & ""</font><font color=brown>""
s2 = EscapeHtml(Mid$(objMatch.Value, 2 + specialOffset))
l2 = IIf(Mid$(s2, Len(s2) - 4, 1) = ""/"", 5, 4)
pos = InStr(s2, ""&nbsp;"")
If pos > 0 Then
s2 = Left$(s2, pos + 5) & ""</font><font color=red>"" & Mid$(s2, pos + 6, Len(s2) - pos - l2 - 5) & ""</font><font color=blue>"" & Right$(s2, l2)
Else
s2 = Left$(s2, Len(s2) - l2) & ""</font><font color=blue>"" & Right$(s2, l2)
End If
s3 = ""</font>"" & Mid$(s, objMatch.FirstIndex + objMatch.Length + 1)
s = s1 & s2 & s3
Next
s = Replace(s, vbCrLf, ""<br />"")
Text1.Text = s
Text1.SelStart = oldPos
Text1.SelLength = oldLen
End Sub

Private Function EscapeHtml(ByVal s As String) As String
EscapeHtml = Replace(Replace(s, ""<"", ""&lt;""), "">"", ""&gt;"")
End Function

Don't forget the helper Function EscapeHtml.
The result looks like this:

Not perfect, but you are welcome to improve it.
You can retrieve the plain, unformatted text like this (PlainText is a built in function)
s = PlainText(Text1.Text)

I made a form with a webbrowser control and a big textbox next to eachother bound to a table with the html in a textfield. The form loads the html text in the text field, where you can edit it and load it in the browser to show the result. You can also set EditOn = true and you can change the html in the browser itself, you have to write code if you want to save the changes made in the browser.

In the legacy Google Apps Script Editor, you could easily create additional Projects that were bound to the parent Sheet / Doc / Slide, under File -> New -> Project.
In the new Google Apps Script Editor, it's easy to add new Files to the existing Project.But I haven't seen a way to create whole new Projects, that are bound to the parent container.
I've read a number of articles talking about the new editor.And for the most part, I agree that it's a great step forward (finally - code blocks!).It's a shame that Find only looks in the active file now, whereas it used to look across all files in the project, but I can get over that.But nothing I've read indicates how to create additional Project bound to the container.Is this feature gone, or am I just missing it somewhere?
"	"
Google has removed the function to create another bound project directly from the new editor, but you can make a clone of the existing bound project by going to the Overview menu and selecting Make a Copy.
The new project will also be bound to the container.

I need to add a single text line at the end of many configuration files (txt-like format). The line is identical for all files.
Is there an automatic command to do it once for all files? I have tried to search in the options of IntelliJ replace in files (CTRL + SHIFT + R window) but I can't find anything to do it automatically.

As you can see, there are options for everything (case, file type, etc...) but nothing that is for my case.
"	"
Just use Replace in Files (Edit â†?Find â†?Replace in Files, or Ctrl+Shift+R in Windows and Linux / âŒ?Shift+R in Mac) to replace this regex:
(.)\Z
with this:
$1\nThis is your line
in any files you need. That's all.

Explanation:
The regex (.)\Z matches and captures the last character in the whole file:

(.) matches and captures any character
\Z matches EOF (end-of-file)

And the replacement uses it to add your line after it:

$1 uses the first capture group (i.e. the previously matched character, to avoid removing it)
\n introduces a new line
This is your line is the line you want to add

You may use the File mask option to select the files you want to change:

Result:

............................................................
Here's how I would do it:

From the File menu open the Settings and select Editor > General. Scroll down and find On Save section and tick the Ensure every saved file ends with a line break. This should look something like this:



Then, in your project, go to Edit > Find > Replace in Path or Ctrl+Shift+R (On Windows & Linux) or Shift+Command+R on MacOS.

In the Replace in Files window tick File mask: and specify your config files. Note: you can use wild cards! *For example, I'm using three files config_1.txt config_2.txt config_3.txt so the mask would be config_*.txt. Here's what's in the config files:




Then select Search with regex - those .* on the right-hand side below the pin icon. Also, select Directory from In Project Module Directory Scope. See the screenshot below.

For 5 & 6 regex credit goes to @walen's answer:

Type (.)\Z in the first search field.

Type $1\n and then type the line you want to append the files with. For example $1\n yet another config line.

Click Replace All.




Your config files should be appended and look like this:



If you're on Linux, save yourself all the trouble and just do this:

echo ""your new line"" | tee -a config_*.txt

PS. I've tested this approach on IntelliJ Community and PyCharm Professional.

Until very recently I would run a script on a Google Sheet with a Time Trigger to update the data on the sheet. Since I started to have problem with the data, I went on the Apps Script panel ""My Triggers"" to remove the time triggers in order to fix the script and the data on the sheet. After removing the triggers, I was unable to find the script in ""My Projects"". I searched every page and looked into the trash, but I can't find my script anymore.
Could anyone please help me restore the script ?
"	"
Once a bounded script has been deleted there is not way to recover it (they don't go to the trash).
If you are a Google Workspace client, you can contact their support.
Also, if you can reproduce it reliably, you should report it on Google Issue Tracker (Apps Script component).

I am creating an IDE using Scintilla in C++. I am trying to create multiple tabs, but every tab must have its own REDO and UNDO state.
This is the behavior I would like to have:

This is the behavior I have now:

"	"
SCI_BEGINUNDOACTION
SCI_ENDUNDOACTION
Send these two messages to Scintilla to mark the beginning and end of a set of operations that you want to undo all as one operation but that you have to generate as several operations. Alternatively, you can use these to mark a set of operations that you do not want to have combined with the preceding or following operations if they are undone.

Try removing the parenthesis, and:

print(file1)
print(file2)

Works for me, p.s. I'm using PyCharm 2021.2.2 Professional Edition on Ubuntu.

In the updated Google Apps Script editor, there is no obvious way to search through all files, a basic IDE feature. In the past, I believe this was the default behavior. Can I accomplish this short of reverting to the legacy editor?

"	"
This is a deficiency known to Google in the upgraded editor and isn't possible other than using the old editor.
Until (if ever) Google fixes it, use this (clunky but functional) extension.

There's current no way that I know of.But you can select ctrl F and then select different files and check them individually

AnypointStudio 7.9 is just supporting for Mule 4.3 EE. Can anyone suggest a suitable IDE to Mule 4.3 Kernel (CE)?
"	"
Mule Kernel specifically targets no graphical IDE:

Download if you are:
Comfortable editing XML directly
Not looking for a graphical modeling and testing environment
Have already created and tested a Mule application and you need to deploy in a separate Mule standalone runtime

Try using a good text editor with XML and Maven support. Visual Studio Code is very good and has support for both.

This question already has an answer here:





Python Interpreter not showing anything in PyCharm

(1 answer)


Closed last year.





I have accidentally deleted venv and .idea folders from my project in pyCharm. I have recreated venv folder using python3 -m venv venv but I can't seem to be able to get the project recognize it.
I can't configure project settings in pyCharm settings, since project menu entry is missing there.
Is there a way to get my project recognized again without creating a new one and moving scripts there?
Thank you in advance.
"	"
You can drag and drop the project's folder onto PyCharm's starting window (the one where projects are listed). That will open it as a project and create a new .idea folder. PyCharm should detect the existing venv and suggest it as the project's interpreter.
............................................................
I have managed to fix it.
I have created new empty project, taken .idea and venv folders from there and copied it to old folder and it somehow works. Not sure that I won't find bugs there, but for now looks good.

You could open your project and right-click project name find [Local History -> Show History].
Try to reset .idea

There is a dedicated tool bar button on the Run/Debug console to enable soft wraps. This setting is remembered. Or you can use the Use soft wraps in console option in Preferences | Editor | General | Console.

I've spent some time already searching for an answer. I know that I can increase the text size in an open file, but is there any way to increase the overall UI scaling? I have a large monitor so I can utilize multiple applications in my workflow, but the size of the application text and icons is so small that it's totally unusable.
Here is a comparison between Eclipse on the left and IntelliJ on the right on my screen:

I scaled IntelliJ on the right to be the perfect size, easily, but Eclipse on the left is way too small to effectively work with it.
I've tried removing a line indicating small text in the eclipse.ini file but that didn't change anything.
Given how poorly my search has turned up already, I assume the answer is 'no'. This leads me to ask, how is this possible? How can such a sophisticated and popular application not be able to change the UI scaling? I feel as though there must actually be a reasonable explanation because this is just plain absurd. This can't be passed off as a legitimate piece of software in this day and age without flexibility on screen size.
Thank you.

EDIT: *

I'm still unable to update the size of the UI icons. I've searched through numerous other issues going through the ""-Dswt.autoScale=200"" options in the elipse.ini setting but this is not working on Mac. Anyone able to assist here? Thank you!
"	"
The ""Tree and Table font for views"" setting in the ""General > Appearance > Colors and Fonts"" page of the Preferences sets the size of Project Explorer view. That entry is in the ""View and Editor Folders"" section.
Icons are only scaled if the display is set up as scaled by x2 or x1.5.

This question has been asked before but I cannot seem to find either YES or NO.
I am fairly a noob when it comes to app development and I can only work with Pascal, and Delphi 2010 is the only IDE my laptop can run without trouble.I have a Compaq CQ58 notebook pc, wth a Intel(R) celeron(R) 1000M @ 1.8 GHz processor 64 bit os and 2 GB RAM.
It is a very low grade laptop, but is it still possible to develop android apps with it? I have Kotlin's IntelliJ IDEA Educational Edition 2021.2.1 insalled but it takes up too much RAM with the Gradle plugin running.
To sum it all up, can an Android app be developed Without an IDE and if so, HOW?
"	"
Without an IDE?Yes.You can use command line gradle commands to compile, and any text editor to write the files-vi or notepad would work.With that low a grade laptop?Gradle is memory hungry.I wouldn't want to compile a non-trivial app on less than 16 GB, and I prefer 32 or 64.The speed of your processor is actually less important than being able to hold enough data in memory for gradle to run.
I don't know where you are in the world, but you can get a cheap PC for only a few hundred dollars.If you can possibly afford it, its well worth the investment.Even if you could build on your laptop, builds would take hours as things paged.2GB has been the minimum settings for most OS for a decade, and it didn't run well in that.You can get a 16 GB machine, which I would consider the minimum, for $500 or less.You don't need a good video card or the fastest processor, but you do need sufficient ram.

Hi some days before I updated my eclipse 2021-06 to 2021-09 and after that its code completion will not show all the methods and classes. For example if I type frame.setS, then it is showing no default proposals.

But At the same time when I type frame.setC and press ctrl+space, it is working This is the

Also in my settings everything is checked.

What I have tried

I searched the web and found many stack overflow questions and I tried the answers. But it didn't work

I deleted the .metedata folder and uninstalled and reinstalled eclipse for 5 times.

I tried installing eclipse from installer and zip.


Is this a bug or something.
I have also installed the java 17 plugin from eclipse marketplace.
Edit
In eclipse 2021-12 (4.22) which released yesterday (08-12-21),
java.awt.* is not filtered out. So no problem. Also it has Java-17 support..

In Eclipse 2021-09 (4.21) everything of java.awt.* is filtered out in the content assist by default.
To disable this default filter, go to the preferences (Window > Preferences; in macOS in the application menu) Java > Appearance > Type Filters and uncheck the checkbox java.awt.*.
I reported it to Eclipse and it has been fixed within two weeks, so it will be in the next release Eclipse 2021-12 (4.22) that will be released on December 8, 2021 (and also sooner in the milestone builds starting with M2):

Problem Description
I updated my windows to windows 11 and when i installed android studio again i started to face problems related to the mouse cursor.
It always looks like this when I open a new file through android studio:

I would like the cursor to look like this:

But for this to be possible I currently have to keep pressing the ""insert"" key on the keyboard every time I go to a new file, and that's pretty annoying.

As described in this solution I did the following that is in the image below:

The problem is not related to windows 11 as I suspected, but rather to the Vim plugin available for the IDE. To solve this, just disable the plugin.

I am trying to program a Microchip MCP4141 digital potentiometer with the STM32CUBEIDE development environment using a NUCLEO F334R8 board. I am sending a 16 bit command through the SPI communications port. When I send the command byte with the data byte, I cannot notice voltage variations between the P0A and P0W terminals of the MCP4141.
Could you help me find the programming error? Thanks
uint8_t data[2];
data[0]=0x00;
data[1]=0x0F;

HAL_GPIO_WritePin(GPIOA, GPIO_PIN_4,GPIO_PIN_RESET);
HAL_SPI_Transmit(&hspi1, data, 2, 500);
HAL_GPIO_WritePin(GPIOA, GPIO_PIN_4,GPIO_PIN_SET);

"	"
Usually when an SPI peripheral does not work, the commands are not received by the slave chip. This can have multiple reasons:

Incorrect wiring (MOSI, MISO, CLK lines)
Incorrect SPI mode (clock phase, clock polarity) --> check SPI settings in CubeMX
Slave chip is in Reset because of incorrect/floating EN or RST Pin

Can you probe the data and clock lines? Do you see a signal being transmitted?
Alternatively, can you successfully read anything from the chips internal memory e.g. the status register?

You cannot access string[i+2] when I is equal to strlen(string) - 1. You can access string[i+1] which will be the terminating nul char.

I started learning python using Jupyter and have used it since to install packages and import them. However recently I installed PyCharm and am not able to import any of the installed packages.
Within Jupyter no matter how much I try the version of python does not update beyond 3.8. With respect to Path variables I've added python 3.9 into the path variable.
How do I use the previously installed libraries with other IDEs such as PyCharm and SublimeText?
Thank you in advance
"	"
You have to re-install it in this new ide.
Each ide is a virtual environment, so installing a module in that ide only installs it for that ide.
That is the main point of environments, you can install the same packages but different versions in each environment.
However one downfall is you need to install the package several times.
............................................................
in pycharm after you install module by using pip.You should install the module from library of pycharm also because sometimes pycharm doesn't add that module to project file so you should follow: on the left top of screen in pycharm File>>Settings>>Project:FÄ°LENAME>>Python interpreter >> '+' button on the left bottom corner >>search the module you want >> install it >> then ready to go

I've been using OMNeT++ for a week, I'm still learning.
I'm learning it as university homework, and I have to send some data about a router from the router itself to a host. In other words, I have to notify a server of the router status.
My professor told me maybe I can use the module called Probe to collect data.
I thought of using the RadioMedium in order to be able to send the data from the router to the Probe, and linking the probe to the server.
But all of this seems useless given that I could use the wlan interfaces of the two nodes (and given that the probe has no gates).
Searching on the web I found that I could use Direct Messages, and I wondered if I could implement a direct message from router to server in the .ini file.
I'd like to know how to do it in details. If that's not the right approach, I don't know what else to do.
I'd prefer not to change the C++ files, as I don't know how to program and even the professor told me to not change the C++ files.
Thank you.
"	"
In OMNeT++ models, different aspects of the system are specified by different files:

INI files are used to specify parameters and configuration
NED files are used to specify topology of the network (and the internals of nodes)
C++ files are used to specify the behavior of the different modules

The thing, you want to achieve (sending some specific data to a host from a router, and I guess also receiving at the host and processing it (otherwise, what's the point?)) is clearly a behavior, so you have to write C++ code.
Most likely you have to write an UDP application, that is installed in both the router and the host and they talk to each other using UDP packets.

I'm studying about C language and wondered about IDE of C.
We all know that we need to install JDK first If we wanna make a Java Program.
but in case of C We just need to install a Compiler (ex.Visual Studio).
do I know clear?
if so Why C doesn't need something like Java's JDK?
is it because our OS already has something to help with it?
or JDK is just a special thing for Java?
I'm sorry for my short English ..!
"	"
You need a C compiler to compile and link your C code to a native executable.But that is all you need.
In this respect1, the difference between C and Java is that the Java compilers compile to bytecodes, not to native code.Bytecodes are not directly executable.To execute the bytecodes you need either a JDK or a JRE2.(It is also possible to generate an executable from Java bytecodes using jlink for example, but that has an embedded JRE.)
The java executable provided by a standard JRE or JDK starts and runs a Java virtual machine (JVM).The functionality of a JVM typicallly includes:

a bytecode loader and verifier,
a bytecode interpreter, and
a Just-in-time (JIT) compiler that compiles bytecodes to platform native code ... as required.

This (e.g. the java command) is implemented as a native application.Existing implementations are coded in C and C++, but that is not an absolute requirement.
You don't absolutely require an IDE for either C or Java.Both can be developed using a simple text editor, and compiled from the command prompt.An IDE is ""nice to have"" ...

1 - There are of course many other differences.
2 - JRE and JDK are names for the two different kinds of Java distribution.A JRE consists of the tools and libraries for running Java applications.A JRE adds development tools; e.g. compilers, packagers, debuggers and so on. (But not an IDE.)
............................................................
IDE is Integrated Development Environment and it is some sort of frontend or GUI for development, i.e. Eclipse (for Java and C/C++) has features like code highlighting,... IDEs are useful for more complex projects to stay on top of things. The main difference between Java and C is that Java is an interpreted language, it needs the JVM (Java Virtual Machine, implemented as a stack machine) to run, while C is directly translated to Assembly and then opcode that runs directly on the processor
The JVM itself is written in C/C++, the JVM generates the opcode for the processor
JAva bytecode is not understandable by the processor it is only understandable for the JVM that is then translates in to ISA opcodes (ISA -> Instruction Set Architecture)

I know that the title is a bit strange, but I was trying some things on my own and by the way, I am a beginner who is currently learning Python.
My problem is, I've tried the same thing on different IDEs and they gave me different results. Jupyter shows me that two different variable names attached to the integer 750 have two different identities (I've made the assignments separately).
But when I try this in PyCharm, two different variable names attached to the integer 750 are giving the same identity. What causes this difference between two IDEs? What am I missing? Which one should I accept?
I've tried this experiment with strings.
for example 'abc', and there is no problem with strings

The built-in Python id function just returns the memory address of that specific object (in Python everything is an object).

This might seem weird, but for some reason Android Studio is acting up, I accidentally created a regular file called MessageC, it asked me to set the file type and I set KT. Afterwords I noticed my mistake, deleted the file and created a new KOTLIN FILE with the same name, but for some reason it seems to have stayed saved in the IDE that MessageC is regular file and not Kotlin file (as renaming it to anything else works fine). This is even after restarting the project, where can I remove this cache?

The behaviour of the Go To Implementation function accessed from the editor context menu or by clicking Ctrl-F12 in Visual Studio has somehow changed in my installation of VS2019.
It used to be that when I used it with the cursor on a method name reference, it would jump directly to the method's implementation unless there were multiple implementations; then it would show them in the Find Symbol Results window.
But something has changed and now it always shows the Find Symbol Results window even if there is only a single implementation. Furthermore, it shows a duplicate of the single implementation or of each if there are more than one. The screenshot shows this where you can see that the same method definition is listed twice with the same Project, File, Line and Column details.

Does anyone have any idea why this might be happening? Could it be some incorrectly cached data causing this? Where might such data be cached? I have cleared my temp files, and deleted contents of folders named *cache in any C:\Users\xxxx\AppData\Local\Microsoft\VisualStudio\16.0* folders but this hasn't made a difference.

The duplication can be caused when there are more than one TargetFrameworks e.g.

Google has failed me. I'd like a way to have TypeScript syntax validation in my Ace editor. I've found an Ace-based TypeScript Playground by basarat AKA 'That TypeScript Guy' but the repo has no good README and I doubt the validator is up to date with TypeScript's newer features, as the last commit is from years ago.
I understand how to add the custom listing itself in Ace; it's just the actual TypeScript linter I am struggling to find. It seems there is no up-to-date maintained one; I'm surprised there isn't one. Currently, I debounce a call to get diagnostics via a library called ts-morph, which provides developer-friendly methods for the TypeScript compiler API. I get those diagnostics, loop over them, and add my own custom annotations to the editor:
const diagnostics = getDiagnostics(code)
aceEditor.getSession().setAnnotations(
diagnostics.map(diagnostic => {
return {
row: diagnostic.getLineNumber() - 1,
column: diagnostic.getStart(),
text: diagnostic.getMessageText().toString(),
type: convertTypeScriptCategoryToAceType(diagnostic.getCategory()),
}
})
)

This is okay for now, but I'd like to do it the 'Ace' way with a Web Worker in the format they suggest.
I am slightly open to migrating away from Ace Editor; for example I also know about TypeScript Playground, but this doesn't seem to have an open-source repository. Other famous online IDEs, like CodeSandbox also must have their ways of doing it. (I looked a little bit into CodeSandbox's source but their repository is expectedly quite complex.)
Can anybody provide me insight into getting nice TypeScript IntelliSense and syntax checking in a web-based IDE? Is it possible via current open source tools?

Close Rider
Delete or rename .idea directory from your solution folder
Start Rider.

If you want, you can try deleting workspace.xml file inside the subdirectory of .idea directory. Only significant difference between the new directory content vs old is, workspace.xml. So you can just delete/rename it and give a try.

I had been using Platform-IO up to 2019 but when I reopened a project things started getting worse and worse. Tasks disappeared and it took a while to be able to compile again. Now Platform-IO has disappeared completely and I was getting deprecation warnings in the ""Toggle developer tool' console.
Now after a complete reinstall of VS, Platform-IO etc. the IDE is still not functioning and I regret ever using it. It is like you jump into your car begging it to start. For professional use (able to restart your car every day without a mechanics) this solution needed to be solid and reliable which it does not seem to be. I will have to switch to another IDE I guess. The name Microsoft should have make me hesitate ...
I am using Windows 7 Professional and NO I WILL NOT UPGRADE THE OS.
Is there any means to install a functioning VS-Code / Platform-IO on Windows 7 or is it just an idea of an IDE ?
Sorry to appear mean but ""Making you more productive"" sounds like a scorn.

I recently tried installing Platform IO on a Win 7 PC of a colleague and experienced similar issues like you. Seems like current Platform IO versions / builds are not compatible and therefore not runnable on Windows 7.
Only idea comes to my mind is using legacy / previous releases of VS Code and Platform IO (manual plugin installation with a legacy release) to get a runnable environment on Win 7, but I didn't test it since I ended up installing a recent Ubuntu next to Win 7. (Seemed like a better solution to me).
Here you can find all of the older releases of VS Code & Platform IO:

I have been using Visual Studios 2019 as my IDE to learn C++ in school for a little over a month now. I often create new CPP files for practice or class lab work which means I have multiple CPP files in a single solution.
I have learned you can 'exclude' CPP files from the solution to allow you to run other CPP files when testing or debugging a program. However I know this isn't a perfect way to do this because it seems that the IDE will often completely remove the files from the solution explorer leaving me with no way to include them back into the solution.
I have set the solution explorer to list all files and have seen the files stay in the solution explorer with the file name still listed with a little 'do not enter' symbol over the file icon to indicate it is not a part of the solution anymore. This is fine as it allows me to right click and interact with the file at will which in turn allows me to include or exclude the file without issue.
I have had so many different and weird issues when doing this but the question I want answered right now is how can I prevent a CPP file (or any file for that matter) from utterly disappearing out of the solution explorer?
"	"
I'd like to suggest a different workflow: create multiple projects within your solution.
Use menu File -> Add -> New Project...
Follow the wizard (likely - Console App), name it as something you can recognize (Lab1, for example).
Now you can select any of your projects in the Solution Explorer and use Set as a Startup Project in the context menu.
This allows you to browse your entire code easily, copy/paste (I don't endorse that :) ), and run/debug the active project.

It will be hard to tell what changed in your project. Check for any JSON/Logstash encoder that got added into your project recently, or any custom log configurations that was recently introduced.
For local dev and debug needs, I keep a gitignored copy of the following xml (logback.xml) in the project classpath, inside src/main/resources

Edit: Fixed!
The Google Apps Script team rolled this out for our team earlier this week (week of January 10th).
Original Post
I'm a frequent GAS user, and I've noticed that, since the upgrade to the V8 runtime, formatting in the GAS IDE is awful. I've seen a somewhat similar question here, but my problem is that the GAS IDE is terrible at formatting ES6 Javascript.
Expected Behavior

variables defined with const or let appear similarly to variables defined with var
the omission of a semicolon will not completely break the indention / formatting of a script
destructured variables will be recognized as variables by the IDE
template literals will be recognized by the IDE

Current Behavior
The IDE basically doesn't recognize any of my JavaScript ES6 syntax. Here's an example:
/** Comments about some function.
* @dev Why does this look like garbage!?
*/
function foo() {
...
 } 

In the above example, it's impossible to get the IDE to properly indent the function. Instead, each line of code is indented to the same extent by default.
Has anyone figured out how to use ES6 syntax, omit semicolons, etc. and gotten the browser-based GAS IDE to format properly?
Thanks!

You might try to use a web browser extension that allow you to set custom CSS styles but the effort required might not be worthy because the new Google Apps Script is being rolled out.
According to the last announcement update the rollout should finish during January 2021
Reference

Use the new Apps Script Integrated Development Environment (IDE) Script Editor

Related

Get ready to up your Apps Script!

............................................................
Workaround
If there are any missing features or behaviours that you don't like on the Apps Script IDE you can:

Update to the newer version of the IDE with more features described here
Use clasp which allows you to develop and manage Apps Script projects from your terminal rather than the Apps Script editor therefore being able to use the IDE of your choice with the features you like.
If there is a specific missing feature you would like the Apps Script editor to have you can report a feature request

My WebStorm's autocomplete stopped working today.
I made a new component and wanted to call it ProductArticleManager as it's the most fitting name for it.

However, the Autocomplete for that single file just refuses to work. Looks like the IDE can't recognize it as a JS file.
I also made another folder called NewComp and made a component NewComp.js to check if it has anything to do with filename matching the folder name, but NewComp.js works fine.
Is there something wrong with this particular name?
What i already did after a little googling:

Restarted the IDE and computer, of course.
Checked that Power Saving Mode is off.
Tried File => Invalidate Cache / Restart option.
Right clicked on the root folder and set it as Resource Root.
Renaming the working test.js file to ProductArticleManager.js turned off the Autocomplete.
Moving the entire folder to another folder.
Deleting ProductArticleManager folder and re-creating it didn't work either.

I work in Ubuntu v20.04, WebStorm v2020.3.
"	"
Looks like the file is treated as plain text.
Please check the registered patterns in Settings | Editor | File types -> Text and Auto-detect file type by content file types - can you see ProductArticleManager.jsthere? Removing this pattern from the list should help

I have been moving from a few days to the 10.4.2 version of Delphi. I immediately noticed a strange problem, the list of the IDE that is used to search for the methods related to the loaded unit in some cases remains empty, so it is not possible to use it to pass to a certain procedure.
After some tests I realized that the problem essentially depends on a procedure, which in my code is present in the definition of all the packages that are used as plugins by the main program, the responsible procedure is the following:
function Command (Id: integer; Params: ansistring; Proc: TProc <TObject> = nil): ansistring; override;

to give the problem is essentially ""= nil"", if I remove it, all the methods magically appear again in the list.
This did not happen on RIO (I haven't tried the previous versions of Sydney), does anyone have any idea how to fix it or will we have to wait for the new update?
"	"
You can turn on Classic Code Insight.
Open Options -> User Interface -> Editor -> Language -> Code Insight tab
There you have combo box where you can choose Code insight manager. Instead of Delphi (Language Server Protocol) you can use Delphi (Classic Code Insight) that was used in previous Delphi versions.

I'm currently doing an internship. I have a Windows program (visual components) that I need to use to control robots in an virtual environment.
You can add to some elements in the program a Python script to do more advanced things. These Python scripts are stored in a few specific folders on the C drive.
If you are in the editor of the program it's just like notepad. I'm new to programming so I would like to use an IDE so that I can import a module and see which functions I can use so that when I type ""system."" and the IDE give me what is possible after the dot.
Problem is when I use PyCharm to open the file directly the modules aren't recognized, however they need in to be in one of those underlaying folders because in the direct editor in the software recognized the module without problems.
How can I configure PyCharm to recognize the modules?
"	"
Specifically for PyCharm: File -> Settings -> Project -> Project structure.
From there, you can 'Add Content Root' and point to the other folders that contain the data you want to be able to edit.
These should then appear on the Project Tab.
HOWEVER, you should be aware that doing this appends these folders to your PATH (where python looks for modules).Depending on your project structure, you may end up importing some files you weren't expecting to.

Why am I getting ""Local path does not exist"" from my Android project in IntelliJ IDEA?

IntelliJ IDEA: Project SDK Settings is not retained after reopenning IDE

Version info:

The path you see in the screenshot is not the path that leads to the IML. Not even by a long shot.

I want to try using the new new Metal-based rendering pipeline on macOS for Java 17, as explained in JEP 382: New macOS Rendering Pipeline. The new feature is not enabled by default. To switch from the default (OpenGL) to the new feature (Metal), one must supply the JVM with command-line arguments upon launch:
-Dsun.java2d.metal=true

I would like try running IntelliJ under Metal rather than OpenGL. So I need to convince IntelliJ to (a) Use Java 17, and (b) pass that argument to the JVM driving its own operations.
I understand that IntelliJ runs on its own internally-bundled JVM rather than the JVM installed on my Mac. So:

How do I know the version of the JVM being used by IntelliJ?
Can I point IntelliJ towards another JVM for its own operations, for a later version of 17 (understanding that I am operating IntelliJ in an untested and unsupported environment)?
How do I pass a command-line argument to that JVM when IntelliJ is launching?

I am using IntelliJ IDEA 2021.2.2 (Ultimate Edition) on macOS Big Sur on MacBook Pro with Apple Silicon (M1 chip).

I am not asking about how to pass command-line arguments to an app being developed within IntelliJ. So I am not asking about how to use the Run/Debug Configurations feature of IntelliJ. That topic has been asked and answered many times already on Stack Overflow.
"	"

How do I know the version of the JVM being used by IntelliJ?

You can find that in the 'about' dialog:


Can I point IntelliJ towards another JVM for its own operations, for a later version of 17 (understanding that I am operating IntelliJ in an untested and unsupported environment)?

Technically you can, but it might cause problems in your IDE I think? There's a warning in their documentation, see Change the boot Java runtime of the IDE to switch to a custom JDK.

How do I pass a command-line argument to that JVM when IntelliJ is launching?

Once your IDE is running, go to Help > Edit Custom VM options, see their Advanced configuration page.

I want to use my phone as an emulator for Visual Studio 2019. I want to use Visual Studio 2019 as an alternative for Android Studio because my pc can't handle it (I only have 4gb RAM). I tried coding in Visual Studio 2019 but I don't have an emulator. I tried downloading ""Visual Studio Emulator for Android"" but the software is not compatible with my pc (I don't know why). So, is it possible to use my phone as an emulator for Visual Studio 2019? and if not, what other alternative IDE can I use for our android app project?
Note: I'm still a student so I don't know much but I really appreciate the help
"	"
yes.
In order get debugging working I did the following.
Go to Settings > About phone and tap Build Number repeatedly until developer mode is enabled
Go into Settings > Developer options and turn USB debugging ON
Connect you phone to your PC via USB. I had to plug my phone into my PC's onboard USB port, not my USB hub as this did not work
You should be prompted to trust your PC (trust it)
Fire up Visual Studio
Open your solution and your device should now be available.
Side note: I have noticed that sometimes it also depends on the cable you use. If you still have no luck, perhaps try another cable.

I have been working with IntellIJ before. There I get suggestions on which function of my library I might want to use when typing. I noticed that in Microsoft Visual Studio this is not the case. Can I enable it somewhere?

*update *
I am getting suggestions about local variables and functions, but not functions and classes of the Unity library I use:

"	"
Within Unity, open Edit -> Preferences -> External Tools -> External Script Editor and from the drop down list selectVisual Studio XXX (2017,.. etc).
If this is not in the drop down, select ""Browse..."" from drop down, go into Visual Studio installation path, by default in Windows OS ""C:\Program Files (x86)\Microsoft Visual Studio\XXX(2017, 2019,....)\Enterprise\Common7\IDE"" and select ""devenv.exe"" file.
Now in the drop down, Visual Studio will have appeared. Close the Preferences window and open the project from ""Assets -> Open C# Project"". and please check the using too, I hope it helps to solve the problem!
............................................................
So I don't know if I understood your question correctly, but you can only get suggestions for classes in Visual Studio if you specify the associated namespace, in your case the Unity library, e.g. using UnityLibary .....
"																															
0	"

In CLion (e.g. 2021.2), if you type namespace foo, nothing special happens. I would have liked it if this would get me:
namespace foo {



} // namespace foo

with the cursor on the middle line. How close can I get to making that happen?
"	"
The best I could manage:

On the menus, go to: File | Settings | Editor | Live Templates.

In the tree view of templates, select C/C++.

Press the tiny + button on the side-bar (far edge of the dialog; why do JetBrains like tiny controls so much?).

Create a template:

Name: ""namespace""
Description: whatever you like
Template text:
namespace $NAMESPACE_NAME$ {

} // namespace $NAMESPACE_NAME$


No need to edit the variables.
reformat according to style enabled (I guess?)
Applicable in: C++ Declaration.



Now, when you type namespace, the completion box will have an option with your chosen description. If you choose it (you still need to press Down-Key once or twice to get to it), then press Enter, you'll get the braces, and a cursor with which you'll need to type the namespace name only once.
This is far from perfect, but it's something.

How can I make my TypeScript project in PhpStorm autocomplete npm packages that don't use TypeScript?
I'm using this npm package called steamcommunity and it does not use TypeScript.
As you can see in the first image the autocomplete doesn't work for this package (which is absolutely frustrating for me cause I have to constantly look into the documentation):

But when I manually change the index.js file of the package (node_modules/steamcommunity/index.js) to index.ts, the autocomplete suddenly starts working:

Is there a better solution than to manually modify the file in node_modules?
EDIT: This is my tsconfig.json:
{
""compilerOptions"": {
""target"": ""es5"",
""module"": ""commonjs"",
""lib"": [""es6""],
""allowJs"": true,
""outDir"": ""build"",
""rootDir"": ""src"",
""strict"": true,
""noImplicitAny"": false,
""esModuleInterop"": true,
""resolveJsonModule"": true,
""checkJs"": true,
""strictNullChecks"": false
}
}

Well I discovered a different kind of ""minor solution"" that basically doesn't solve it in general but anyway... it's auto-generating the types for the package yourself and creating a pull request for the TypeScript-less package...
I discovered this npm package called dts-gen that auto-generates the types for a given package automatically and it works almost perfectly and it recognized almost all the methods from different files and it put it all together.
This is how I used it:

npm i -g dts-gen
npm i -g steamcommunity
dts-gen -m steamcommunity

This generated a single file called steamcommunity.d.ts which contains all the types of different classes, functions and variables. I forked the original package repository, renamed the generated file to index.d.ts and put it into the root folder, pushed it and created a pull request.

I've downloaded AppCode for iOS development. For my personal project I've a bunch of simulator to chose from. But for a work project there is no simulator but only ""Add Configuration"" (image attached below)

I've already tried a bunch of stuff like the ones mentioned here AppCode can't run on simulator and device and here AppCode found no simulators to run but none of them seems to work.
The project has unchecked ""Automatically manage signing"" duo to some work requirements.Does anyone know how to run AppCode and this particular project in a simulator? Why this project has no simulator while my personal project has the whole list?

Edit:

"	"
AppCode configurations are different from Xcode schemes. You'll need to add a configuration, selecting a target to run. (If you select an app target, ""Run"" will run your app. If you select a test target, ""Run"" will run your tests.)
Once you have a configuration with an iOS target, you'll be able to select one of the simulators.

My mistake was that I imported the whole project in AppCode instead of opening the xcworkspace with AppCode!

Download ""Eclipse IDE for Java Developers"" (2020-09 a.k.a 4.17) from https://www.eclipse.org/downloads/packages/release/2020-09/r
Note: The first link on the page gets you the Oomph installer which WILL NOT WORK. Use one of the links below. If there is ""inst"" anywhere in the name of the file you downloaded, try again.
The reason why Oomph breaks GRECLIPSE is that it will add an update site which will try to install the latest 4.x GRECLIPSE -> fail.
Unpack the archive somewhere.
Go to Help -> Install New Software.
Add this update site: https://dist.springsource.org/release/GRECLIPSE/3.9.0/e4.17
(Using the marketplace will leave you with GRECLIPSE 4.x)
Always select the main package and Maven support if you need it.
Click Next.
Make sure that it tries to install 3.9.0 and nothing else.
Click Next & Finish until it installs.
--- old instructions for reference ---
You will need to download Eclipse Photon from here

and then Groovy Feature 3.5.0.v201909291357-e48-RELEASE add this update site:
https://dist.springsource.org/release/GRECLIPSE/e4.8

All the versions of Eclipse after this one don't support Groovy 2.4 anymore.
I've tried to do this with Oomph but that way, I always ended up with Groovy Feature 4.1.
My solution then was to create another workspace for all my Groovy 2.4 projects (Jenkins Pipelines, mostly).

I'm looking to build a web app with HTML, TS, SASS, Jquery.
I looked into using Visual Studio for this but it looks like all web projects would require some server side code?
Should I use VS Code instead? Even though I have more experience with VS.
"	"
If you are only going to use HTML, TS, SASS and Jquery, and other client side technologies, VS Code is more than enough.
Some advantages of VS Code are:

It is 100% Free
Lightweight. Uses less computer resources (Memmory, processor)
You can run it in Windows, Linux and MacOs
It can be perzonalized a lot throught extensions.

Can you work with those technologies (HTML, TS, SASS, and JQuery) with Visual Studio? Yes. However, considering that it requires more resources and it does not give you any advantage than using VS Code, using VS Code is a better option.
In the future, if your needs require it, you always will be able to install Visual Studio.

What is difference between scanf(""%d"") and scanf(""%d "") in this code, where the difference is the trailing blank in the format string?

#include <stdio.h>

int main(void)
{
int i, j;

printf(""enter a value for j "");
scanf(""%d"",&j);
printf(""j is %d\n"", j);
printf(""enter a value for i "");
scanf(""%d"", &i);
printf(""i is %d\n"", i);
return 0;
}


How does the scanf() function actually work when I add spaces after the format specifier like scanf(""%d"", &j);?
"	"
A whitespace character in a scanf format causes it to explicitly read and ignore as many whitespace characters as it can.So with scanf(""%d "", ..., after reading a number, it will continue to read characters, discarding all whitespace until it sees a non-whitespace character on the input.That non-whitespace character will be left as the next character to be read by an input function.

With your code:

printf(""enter a value for j "");

scanf(""%d"",&j);

printf(""j is %d \n"", j);


it will print the first line and then wait for you to enter a number, and then continue to wait for something after the number.So if you just type 5Enter, it will appear to hang â€?you need to type in another line with some non-whitespace character on it to continue.If you then type 6Enter, that will become the value for i, so your screen will look something like:

enter a value for j 5
6
j is 5
enter a value for i i is 6


Also, since most scanf %-conversions also skip leading whitespace (all except for %c, %[ and %n), spaces before %-conversions are irrelevant (""%d"" and ""%d"" will act identically).So for the most part, you should avoid spaces in scanf conversions unless you know you specifically need them for their peculiar effect.
............................................................
A white-space character (space, newline, horizontal and vertical tab) in a format string matches any number of white-space characters in the input.
In your first case 

scanf(""%d"",&j);


when it encounters the white-space char (WSC) ' ' then it will eat all the white spaces input by user including \n on pressing Enter and it will expect to enter a non-WSC . In this case your program will terminate by pressing Ctrl + Z.
............................................................
A whitespace character in your scanf format matches any number of whitespace characters as described by isspace. So if you have tailing spaces, newlines, tabulators or any other whitespace character then it will also be consumed by scanf before it returns.
............................................................
The difference (although obvious) is a different format string. If you enter the following line:

""3Â Â ""

scanf() will return successfully. Otherwise, it depends on your input provided. scanf() essentially skips over whitespace (tabs, spaces, newlines), and searches for alphanumeric values in the input stream. Since this is trailing whitespace, it gets lumped in with the trailing newline character at the end of input when pressing ENTER, so it's of little consequence.

scanf() expects the input provided to exactly match the format string you provide to it, with the exception that contiguous whitespace characters are compressed to a single whitespace character. This becomes very important if you want to parse large strings of data with it's string-processing equivalent, sscanf().

A good exercise to further test this would be something like:

#include<stdio.h>

int main(void)
{
 int a=0,b=0,c=0;

 printf(""Enter values for A, B, C, in the format: \""A B-C\""\n"");
 scanf(""%d %d-%d"", &a, &b, &c);

 printf(""Values: A:%d, B:%d, C:%d\n"", a, b, c);
}


Afterwards, check and see what the values of these integers are after providing both correctly and incorrectly formatted consoled input (ie: spaces and hyphens). Here are a couple example runs. The first used incorrect input, the second used correctly formatted input. Notice that in the first case, C doesn't even get set, as scanf() will provided unexpected behavior if the input and the format strings don't match up. In general, you are better off using something like fgets() to get a string of input from the user, and then use various search functions (ie: strstr(), strch(), strcat, strcpy, etc) to parse your string, as it is much safer than just using scanf() and assuming the user won't make a mistake, either accidentally or deliberately.

Enter values for A, B, C, in the format: ""A B-C""
1 2 3
Values: A:1, B:2, C:0

Enter values for A, B, C, in the format: ""A B-C""
1 2-3
Values: A:1, B:2, C:3


Now, consider one last run: You'll see that scanf() compacts multiple consecutive whitespace characters to a single character, hence why these final runs actually succeeds:

Enter values for A, B, C, in the format: ""A B-C""
1 2 - 3
Values: A:1, B:2, C:3

Enter values for A, B, C, in the format: ""A B-C""
1 2 - 3
Values: A:1, B:2, C:3

Everywhere I see Python code importing modules using import sys or import mymodule

How does the interpreter find the correct file if no directory or path is provided?
"	"
http://docs.python.org/3/tutorial/modules.html#the-module-search-path

6.1.2. The Module Search Path
When a module named spam is imported, the interpreter first searches for a built-in module with that name. If not found, it then searches for a file named spam.py in a list of directories given by the variable sys.path. sys.path is initialized from these locations:

The directory containing the input script (or the current directory when no file is specified).
PYTHONPATH (a list of directory names, with the same syntax as the shell variable PATH).
The installation-dependent default.


Note: On file systems which support symlinks, the directory containing the input script is calculated after the symlink is followed. In other words the directory containing the symlink is not added to the module search path.

After initialization, Python programs can modify sys.path. The directory containing the script being run is placed at the beginning of the search path, ahead of the standard library path. This means that scripts in that directory will be loaded instead of modules of the same name in the library directory. This is an error unless the replacement is intended. See section Standard Modules for more information.

For information on the ""installation-specific default"", see documentation on the site module.
............................................................
Also, you can see what the current path is by using the sys module

import sys
print(sys.path)

............................................................
It uses the PYTHONPATH, set as an environment variable, to find packages (folders containing __init__.py files) and modules (or, if already loaded once, retrieves the module object from sys.modules).
............................................................
Python has a path variable just like the one you have inside your terminal. Python looks for modules in folders inside that path, or in the folder where your program is located.

I am accessing the script editor on an iPad - iOS 14.4 via Safari. The old editor populates without on starting script and the menu and option to go to the new editor do not function.Everything works fine in Chrome on my Mac, problem only exists on the iPad in Safari.
Any suggestions to use the editor in this situation?

In Visual Studio, it is very hard to pass to another tab. You can't Alt+1, Alt+2 to pass to another tab, and you can Ctrl+Tab to pass but it is slow, and the tab sizes are soooooo small that it is really hard to click on them. Zooming on font sizes don't help. And I couldn't find an answer online.
Could you tell me how to make the tabs bigger, so that I can easily click on them?
I am using Visual Studio Community 2019-16.8.6
Here is a screenshot of what I want:

This is tricky to find, primarily because most of us don't realize (or forget) that the Fonts and Colors dialog has a ""Show settings for:"" selector at the top.
So, to change it, from the VS IDE menu:

Select Tools -> Options..,
Click on Environment..Fonts and Colors in the Options Explorer (the pane on the left-hand side)
At the top center is a grayed-out dropdown titled ""Show settings for:"", select Environment from this,
Set ""Display Items:"" to Plain Text, then use the ""Fonts"" dropdown to change it from Automatic to whatever font and size you want.

You can use my Tabs Studio extension to set tabs font size:

And assign shortcuts to pass to a tab by number:

Install the Visual Studio extension Font Sizer 2.0. Then you will be presented with the ability to quickly change it via the keyboard or menu option:

As to tab switching, I've been using Alt -> Tab which switches immediately back to the previous window. If you hold the keystroke chord, it will give you a list of open editor windows and you can move within the list or even select via a mouse.

So basically I am a starter in programming. I do not understand how do I compile and run the program below on Harvard's CS50 IDE.
#include<iostream>
using namespace std;
int main()
{
cout<<""HelloCS50"";
}

enter image description here
"	"
Start typing in the terminal. follow each command you type with the enter key.
Use the command ls to list all the files in your directory. One of those files should be the code you just wrote and saved.
It's not a requirement, but will make it easier to have the filename end in '.cpp'. If your file does not have that, you can save the file again and add '.cpp' to the filename.
Assuming that your filename is ""hello.cpp"", use the command g++ hello.cpp to compile your code. This will create another file called a.out.
You can now run your code with the command ./a.out. After doing this you should see that ""HelloCS50"" has been printed onto the screen.
............................................................
1: save your file name with .cpp extension. If your file does not have that, you can save the file again and add '.cpp' to the filename.
2: Consider that your filename is ""hello.cpp"", use the command make hello to compile your code. This will create another file called hello.
3: Now you can write your code with the commond ./hello. After doing this you should see the Output.

You can use bookmarks. They work somewhat similarly to breakpoints, without pausing execution when you're debugging.
You can add them via the context menu.

If I recall, you're a bit limited by the amount of information you can add. It's basically just a single text box.
See the help section on bookmarks
Maybe there's some plugins which extend the functionality (e.g. this one for adding keyboard shortcuts)

I've been using R since before its official first release but don't have a lot of knowledge of R Studio's ""bells and whistles.""One thing I was trying to do in R Studio is the following:I want to write a function (or use some other functionality possibly available in R Studio) that when run, returns source code to the source code editing window in R Studio at the point where the function is called.This is sort of like an alias, perhaps for a longer block of code.For example if I have some R code like this:
insertCode(""John Smith"", ""August 23, 2020"")
library(tidyverse)

and I execute the first lineâ€”or even better, after I type the line and press return, tab or some other characterâ€”I'd like R Studio to return some templated code to the window and replace the function (or alternatively place it below my insertCode function call).In this example, I was thinking the code, when executed or typed, would replace the line insertCode(""John Smith"", ""August 23, 2020"") with program description text so that the following would appear in my source code editor:
###############################################
Author:John Smith
Last Modified: August 23, 2020
###############################################
library(tidyverse)

I realize I could just save a template of source code and open it up any time I need to do this, but I have other ideas of how I'd like to use this functionality too besides inserting program description headers into my code.Is this possible somehow?
Thanks in advance for your assistance.

I think you are looking for ""Code Snippets"". RStudio allows you to save ""templates"" that are inserted automatically in your source editor when you type certain strings, followed by the ""Tab"" key.

(Based on rioV8's comments).
In C++, & has different meanings depending on context. It can be the address-operator, it can denote a reference, it can also be a binary bit-and operator. To distinguish all these, you need to parse the tokens next to it. && is only marginally simpler, it can't be a unary operator.
In T & x, you need to know if T is a type or a value. That requires applying C++ name lookup rules on T. We can see in your example that it's typename T. However, Visual Studio Code does not parse C++ to color the text, and therefore gets the category wrong. You cannot fix this; this needs to be fixed by Microsoft.

I need to put my code into a word document with line numbers but when I copy it the line numbers are not copied.
I printed it to a pdf and while this gave the line numbers, I couldn't copy the formatting into the word document (lost colours when copied from pdf to word document too).
Does anyone know how I can copy code from Eclipse with line numbers without losing the formatting?
"	"
Every editor has their own language environment and word is just a text editor with no language environment in it that why you won't be able to see your code with number lines or color-coding.
If you switch to some other text editor like sublime you might be able to work more freely in it.
............................................................
Here are a couple of options.

Find a site on the web that offers a text numbering service.I actually found one but am reluctant to post the link.I am certain there are many.Then past your code there, renumber and recopy. This worked when I tried it.

Another solution (the fun one) would be to write a java program to accept pasted text and renumber for you.You could specify this an an external editor and add any controls you like.Or find an editor that does this.From Eclipse you can reopen your current Eclipse editor's contents using another app.

And finally, there's the screen grab.


Unfortunately, I could not find an intrinsic capability in Eclipse to do this.A possibility related to number (2) above would be an Eclipse plugin.

I believe I am responsible for this change in IntelliJ's display, but I do not know what I have done to cause the issue. I have a variable, data in my application that when the debugger was stopped at a breakpoint after its assignment, formerly would nicely display all its internal properties and their values, something like this:
â–?data
â–?propertyOne: Map
â–?propertyTwo: Map

However, I now see a stackOverflow error while trying to call a toString method (not sure why), and instead of data's internal properties, I see methods like head, tail, accessOrder, table, see the screenshot:

I believe this may have happened when I right-clicked data and selected ""Inspect"". But I'm not certain that is the cause.
How can I make the variables tab in the debugger show me the selected variable's properties and all of their values?
Edit: Adding screenshot of what happens when one of the nodes is expanded and toString is clicked:

I could not uninstall Eclipse IDE, so I deleted all Eclipse related files from my PC. Now I cannot re-install the program anymore. I keep getting this weird error. I have no idea what is going on.
"	"
Deleting the Eclipse directory is actually the only way to uninstall Eclipse, so you didn't do anything wrong.
To me it looks like some bundle is missing or corrupted. It might help to delete the .p2 directory in your User directory and then try to install it again.

Basically after changing files in PhpStorm and commiting I get a lot of these blank line changes but I haven't touched any of them.

I turned on ""keep indent on empty lines"" and turned off ""remove trailing spaces"" but it didn't fix the problem.
What's going on here? For now I have to stage lines instead of whole files to avoid pushing garbage changes but that's less than ideal.
"	"

I turned on ""keep indent on empty lines"" and turned off ""remove trailing spaces"" but it didn't fix the problem.

Settings/Preferences | Editor | General | Remove trailing spaces on: is indeed the option that controls such behaviour. As per your description you already have that disabled.
If you have .editorconfig files in your project then corresponding setting from there (trim_trailing_whitespace) will overwrite corresponding IDE settings. It is expected as it's the whole nature of such files.
In this case you have a few options here:

either edit your .editorconfig file accordingly (https://github.com/editorconfig/editorconfig/wiki/EditorConfig-Properties#trim_trailing_whitespace)

or disable such support in the IDE (Settings/Preferences | Editor | Code Style | Enable EditorConfig support)


or even more radical one: disable EditorConfig plugin completely (which affects the whole IDE: all projects / code styles).

I try to do parallel processing in python, my IDE was Spyder. I could not! I tried the same codes in other IDEs like PyCharm and it worked. How can I fix the Spyder IDE to do it for me? I tried the official Python documentation below, all of them give errors in Spyder IDE!!
https://docs.python.org/3.8/library/multiprocessing.html#multiprocessing.get_context
"	"
I used all the codes in python documentation for parallel processing. The link is:
https://docs.python.org/3.8/library/multiprocessing.html#multiprocessing.get_context
it seems Spyder has issues, instead, I used PyCharm, and it worked perfectly.

I started using the PhpStorm IDE.
I found the perfect mode for coding called Zen Mode.
But I have one point to make about this. Its left border is so wide. How can I change this?

"	"
In Zen / Distraction Free mode the code is kind of centred (hence that big gap on the left: it gets bigger on a wider screen). It is by design. You may want to use Full Screen mode instead. https://www.jetbrains.com/help/phpstorm/2021.1/ide-viewing-modes.html
You may also want to check these links for some tips on how to customize your IDE:

https://www.jetbrains.com/help/phpstorm/2021.1/tool-windows.html


Regarding the editor gutter width in general: see IDEA-148002 and check the comments and linked tickets there.

How does one set the default directory for the VBA Editor?
This ought to be obvious in any application, not to mention an obligatory feature, but I can't figure it out.
Having to navigate up and over my directory structure from an irrelevant /user/documents directory every time I import or export a module is nuts.
"	"
It turns out that the VB Editor default directory can't be set.
The best that can be done is to configure the OS to map the user's Documents directory elsewhere.

I have created a simple program that runs in Eclipse when I click on run. The class containing the main method (""HelloMain.java"") instantiates a second class, ""Hello.java"" This works fine in Eclipse but I much prefer using Sublime Text 3 and when I run the same program in Sublime from the terminal I get a symbol not found error during instantiation.
I don't know why I am getting a symbol not found error, can you please comment if you have any ideas on why this is happening or if you have any ideas on how to fix this?
I've included a screenshot.

On the left you can see my program HelloMain.java
Below HelloMain.java you can see my second class, Hello.java
Below Hello.java you can see my terminal where I attempt to run my program

On the right you can see the same files

HelloMain.java
Below HelloMain.java is Hello.java
Below Hello.java is the terminal where I run the program with the exact same issue
and below that is the program functioning through the console

Please let me know if you have any questions or need clarification.
Thank you.

All of my files were not being compiled. I run my code through zsh, my terminal doesn't automatically compile all or any files unless it is specified. ""javac"" compiles a file.
This line of commands compiled and ran my java files in a folder.
The package and folder of the files I am running are both called model and I am in a subdirectory when running these commands.
""javac **/*.java && java model.HelloMain"".

I need the Android studio to work like before.









I have Android studio dolphin version.
While I try to open Android studio, an error dialog box appears and it shows like

And also another dialog box appears as

Unable to save settings
Failed to save settings. Please restart Android Studio

On the top, in the configuration tab, it now shows Add Configuration where it showed app with an android icon previously.
The project explorer keeps on loading forever. The same problem occurs whenever I try to create a new project as well.
There is no modules.xml file and some folders in the .idea folder are missing which the previous projects have.
What I have tried so far

Invalidated caches and Restarted

Deleted .idea and .app folder and restarted

Created a new project to check if the same error occurs

Uninstalled and reinstalled Android studio

Clicked on Repair IDE and followed the steps

Installed previous android studio versions and checked


But none the above steps seem to help resolve the issue.
"	"
I know it's an old post, but it's relating to a similar issue and might still be of use:
Android Studio - Gradle sync failed: Already disposed
As stated,

As it turned out, the problem was that I was trying to open a project directory that was a symlink to the actual location (on the same partition). Gradle (on command line) had no issues building the project from the symlinked location, however, opening it in Android Studio resulted in the obscure and non helpful error described above.

Also, some have reported this worked for them:

Delete module folder and modules.xml file under .idea folder.
Close Android Studio
Reopen and sync

So it might effectively be because your module.xml file is missing

I am trying to create a document in Latex (MiKTex) using Texmaker for Linear Algebra. I wrote some text in page and now want to adjust picture in bottom of that text but picture goes to up the text automatically.
This is output of the code in this Image
There is code:
\begin{Large}

\justify
LaTeX is a software system for document preparation. When writing, the writer uses plain text as opposed to the formatted text found in ""What You See Is What You Get"" word processors like Microsoft Word, LibreOffice Writer and Apple Pages.\\
\\LaTeX is widely used in academia for the communication and publication of scientific documents in many fields, including mathematics, statistics, computer science, engineering, physics, economics, linguistics, quantitative psychology, philosophy, and political science. It also has a prominent role in the preparation and publication of books and articles that contain complex multilingual materials, such as Sanskrit and Greek. LaTeX uses the TeX typesetting program for formatting its output, and is itself written in the TeX macro language.\\
\\To download and install Latex we have to download two software, one is MiKTeX and second one is Texmaker, in first steps we will download and install MiKTex and then we will install Texmaker.

You should add the float package (\usepackage{float}) in your preamble and then add the floating specifier to your figure (\begin{figure}[b])
The basic specifiers:
h - places the float here, i.e., approximately at the same point it occurs in the source text (however, not exactly at the spot);
t - positions it at the top of the page;
b - positions it at the bottom of the page.

I told a friend I would help her out with a website for a small business.It would just have the typical Home, About, Contact Us etc for a small business.
For work, Iâ€™ve worked on websites in angular, ExtJS, etc using IDEs like Eclipse and IntelliJ with typically a java back-end.
Would all of this be a bit of overkill for a typical small business web site that's not going to do anything very complicated?Would I be better off using WordPlay or some other non-coding web builder?
Thanks much
"	"
If you are going to be coding the project I recommend using VSCode IDE(https://code.visualstudio.com/). It's simple to use, lightweight and offers a lot of extensions to ease and make efficient front-end (and back-end) development. Make sure to install extension LiveServer to quickly start your own localhost. Optional you can add other extensions like snippets, formating extensions etc..
For non coding project you can visit the Wordpress site and create a website with Elementor. It's easy to use and offers plenty of features to create a small business site. Here is a quick guide to get you started (https://blog.hubspot.com/website/how-to-use-elementor)

What does this symbol mean in IntelliJ? Lighting symbol on Java class name.
I have seen ""I"" for interface and ""C"" for a class But first time noticing this lighting symbol.
"	"
This icon represents an Exception class (a class extending Exception).

You can hover your mouse cursor on any icon in the project view to see the description like this:

IntelliJ IDEA documentation for 2020.1 version is the last archive copy of the product help that has this reference.

When writing code in cshtml files, sometimes intellisense goes haywire and starts writing text several lines above where I am actually typing. At the moment it seems to be limited to when I hit the tab key to let it finish a property name which isn't too bad because I can just not do that. However, it also seems to happen at other times like just when I type @Model and then press a period it might write the word Model in some other part of the code file.
Anyone know how to correct this?

This would probably fit better as a VS Feedback item, but since this is the only place I have found someone referencing the same issue, I thought I would add some confirmation.I do not have a solution, only more examples to add.This issue has been annoying me for months!It seems to happen most often when typing razor code inside of JavaScript, especially inside of a quoted string.
Here is an example from a test project, where I am attempting to put a reference to a model field into a JavaScript string.Notice that I click tab a couple times and it doesn't actually insert the intellisense result at the point I am typing.But when I scroll down you can see it inserted it randomly in another spot pretty far away!

I did also try to remove the hidden .vs folder, bin/, and obj/ and could still reliably reproduce the issue after restarting Visual Studio.Currently on 1 before the latest (16.9.4).I did notice that if I re-open this cshtml file, wait until the file seems to be fully loaded (all the red errors go away), I also reliably get an ArgumentException that occurs as I begin typing.Then when I scroll down I already see that Model has been randomly inserted in another spot in the code.

I'm going to try updating to latest (16.9.5), and starting in Safe Mode to skip loading all 3rd-party libraries, and see if the issue is still reproducible, in case it is caused by one of the handful of extensions I am currently using.
Edit: Well same issue with 16.9.5.Trying to use Safe Mode is a no go, it makes the intellisense and syntax coloring completely disabled for .cshtml files.

Is there a way to group windows on a secondary monitor ? Right now, i can move for example the Console or Debug window as a separate window on my second screen, but cannot seem to be able to group them.
On eclipse i was able to do something like this:

Does IntelliJ support something similar ? I can only seem to be able to group them on my main screen, but not once i undock them.

As of 2020, are there any features of Android Studio not contained in IntelliJ IDEA Ultimate? I know that there are similar questions about that, but they all refer to older versions of both apps.
Let's make the comparison between the newest versions as of 09/22/2020:

IntelliJ IDEA Ultimate Version 2020.2.2
Android Studio 4.0.1

Any answer is appreciated.
Thanks in advance!

IntelliJ IDEA 2020.2 contains all the Android Studio 4.0 functionality.

I have a special project and I haven't been able to find any information on how I can achieve this.
So on this website companies can register and login.
When a company is logged in they have an overview of devices and groups where devices can be divided in different groups for easy recognition.
Now the hard part of the website is template management. Each device will display a template which could be a general specified template, a template that was assigned to a specific group or to an individual device. The templates that are chosen are either standard provided templates, custom templates made by the company or custom templates tailored by me. (The last 2 options are only visible for the company itself)
The main reason for this is to display different templates with that I mean structural differences like a table, cards and even custom structures.
So at the moment I am able to display templates based on the id of the company. These templates are integrated within the angular app.
So now it kinda looks like this (its just a small example):
this.companyName = this.route.snapshot.params['company'];
if(this.companyName == ""Google""){
this.template = `<div [ngStyle]=""{'border-left':(tr.state=='busy')?'10px solid #D4061C':'10px solid #2CC52E'}"">{{data}}</div>`;
this.styles = ""div{color: red}"";
}

What happens afterwards is the creation of a component on the fly by keeping the compiler in the build.
So this means that this project cannot be build in production mode as the compiler is required.
Which means that deploying the project is awful because the code is visible in the browser and the size is much larger so it takes too much time to load everything in. I kinda want to step away from this method and use something else which is easier to use
So what I want to know is:

is it possible to load in html from either data in the database or from HTML files.
is this possible by using any other library with Angular.
is there a way to create an overview of templates that I offer to companies that displays a preview of that template as well?
Is there a way to retrieve the ip and mac address of the device that is displaying the template.

If it isn't possible to use Angular for this what environment like language, frameworks, etc. do you advise to use instead?
If more information is required don't hesitate to ask away!
Thanks in Advance!
Edit 1:
I have tried to use [innerHTML] to load in the template but this doesn't work properly with data binding or data interpolation strings.

Entering this kind of template can easily generate issues especially in innerHTML because of XSS protection. So I would like to know whether there is a different solution to this since there might be hundreds of customers with hundreds of different templates.
An example how a template could look like:

EDIT 2:
What I mean with:

is this possible by using any other library with Angular.

is if it is not possible to achieve this using standard methods are there any libraries to could enable me to achieve this anyways.
EDIT 3:
So the idea of a template suggestion system is really nice, but the customer wants to create it and add it directly without other customers to see this.
This way I need to be able to save HTML files in the backend (whether it are templates or full pages doesn't matter) and load it inside of the angular application.
For as far as I am understanding all the answers below this will not be possible in Angular.
My question now is in which environment or language can I achieve this template mechanism? Or is there still a unknown method that is safe to use for production in Angular?
Thanks in advance!
Update 15/12/2020:
After implementing Owen Kelvins idea, I have found a few issues with this.
Using ngFor loops to loop over data doesn't work. Also adding pipelines inside of the interpolation strings do not work.
To solve the pipeline issue you can solve this by making changes to the prev.toString() line:
templateString$ = combineLatest([this.templatingInfo$, this.template$]).pipe(
map(([info, template]) =>
Object.entries(info).reduce((prev, next) => {
var value = next[1].toString();
var pipe = """";
var pipevalue = """";
var match = prev.toString().match(new RegExp(`{{\\s${next[0]}\\s(\\|\\s\\w*\\:\\s\\'\.*\\'\\s)+}}`));
if (match != null) {
pipe = match[1].substring(2);
if (pipe.split("":"")[0] == ""date"") {
pipevalue = pipe.substr(5).replace(/['""]/g, """");
value = formatDate(value, pipevalue, this.locale);
return prev.toString().replace(new RegExp(`{{\\s${next[0]}\\s(\\|\\s\\w*\\:\\s\\'\.*\\'\\s)+}}`), formatDate(next[1].toString(), pipe.substring(5).replace(/['""]+/g, """"), this.locale));
}
}
return prev.toString().replace(new RegExp(`{{\\s${next[0]}\\s}}`), next[1].toString());
}, template)
),
map(template => this._sanitizer.bypassSecurityTrustHtml(template))
);

Ofcourse this method doesn't work completely as in some cases it still doesn't display it correctly. Like when you have: <div>{{date | date: 'EEEE d MMMM y' }} - {{date | date: 'HH:mm' }}</div>, as in this case only the first one would be correct.
I would like to know how I could fix both the ngFor loop as the pipeline issue.
Thanks in Advance!

I believe the easiest solution will be to bind to [innerHTML] as earlier mentioned by @capc0
You raised below concern

Hi @capc0 your answer is completely correct. But, yes there is a but! I am using interpolation strings inside my html, innerHTML works fine but that is with static HTML. I am talking about HTML that has data interpolation strings which doesn't work properly with innerHTML

Consider below approach to deal with this problem
Lets say we are to interpolate title and cost from the below object
templatingInfo$ = of({
title: 'Template Title',
cost: 200
});

I will also assume that the templates are received in the form of an Observable
templates$ = of([
{ 
id: 1,
name: 'Alpha',
value: `
<div class='red'> 
<h1>{{ title }}</h1>
<p> This is my lovely Template! Purchase it at \${{ cost }} </p>
</div>
`
},
{ 
id: 2,
name: 'Beta',
value: `
<div class='blue'> 
<h1>{{ title }}</h1>
<p> This is my lovely Template! Purchase it at \${{ cost }} </p>
</div>
`
},
 ...


Now the only challenge is to replace the interpolated section with the correct info
I will solve this with the below approach
Define variables to track the selected template
selected = 1;
selectedTemplateSubject$ = new BehaviorSubject(this.selected);
selectedTemplate$ = this.selectedTemplateSubject$.asObservable();

use combineLatest to combine the variables with template
template$ = combineLatest([this.templates$, this.selectedTemplate$]).pipe(
map(([templates, selected]) => templates.find(({id}) => id == Number(selected)).value),
)
templateString$ = combineLatest([this.templatingInfo$, this.template$ ]).pipe(
map(([info, template]) => 
Object.entries(info).reduce((prev, next) => 
prev.toString().replace(new RegExp(`{{\\s${next[0]}\\s}}`), next[1].toString())
, template)
),
)

The above works unfortunately styles will not be applied.
Option 1
With that we can use
encapsulation: ViewEncapsulation.None, in our @Component({}) object see Angular 2 - innerHTML styling
NB: WE ARE LITERALLY DEACTIVATING ANGULAR PROTECTION AGAINST XSS ATTACK
With the above said, you now have a few options

Sanitize the template string before saving it to the database
Manually sanitize the template string before rendering it
Only make the template available for the individual users who posted it. This way they probably will only attack themselves :)

See this Sample
Option 2
The other option is to use DomSanitizer as explainer in This Post
Lets assume users have included inline styles like below
templates$ = of([
{
id: 1,
name: ""Alpha"",
value: `
<div> 
<h1 style='color: red'>{{ title }}</h1>
<p style='color: blue'> This is Alpha! Purchase it at \${{ cost }} </p>
</div>
`
},
{
id: 2,
name: ""Beta"",
value: `
<div> 
<h1 style='color: brown'>{{ title }}</h1>
<p style='color: green'> This is Alpha! Purchase it at \${{ cost }} </p>
</div>
`
},
...

We can add the line map(template => this._sanitizer.bypassSecurityTrustHtml(template)) to map the resultant string to a trusted string. The code will look like
import { Component } from ""@angular/core"";
import { of, BehaviorSubject, combineLatest } from ""rxjs"";
import { map } from ""rxjs/operators"";

import { DomSanitizer } from ""@angular/platform-browser"";

@Component({
selector: ""my-app"",
templateUrl: ""./app.component.html"",
styleUrls: [""./app.component.css""]
})
export class AppComponent {
constructor(private _sanitizer: DomSanitizer) {}
templatingInfo$ = of({
title: ""Template Title"",
cost: 200
});
selected = 1;

selectedTemplateSubject$ = new BehaviorSubject(this.selected);
selectedTemplate$ = this.selectedTemplateSubject$.asObservable();
templates$ = of([
{
id: 1,
name: ""Alpha"",
value: `
<div> 
<h1 style='color: red'>{{ title }}</h1>
<p style='color: blue'> This is Alpha! Purchase it at \${{ cost }} </p>
</div>
`
},
{
id: 2,
name: ""Beta"",
value: `
<div> 
<h1 style='color: brown'>{{ title }}</h1>
<p style='color: green'> This is Alpha! Purchase it at \${{ cost }} </p>
</div>
`
},
{
id: 3,
name: ""Gamma"",
value: `
<div> 
<h1 style='color: darkred'>{{ title }}</h1>
<p style='color: green'> This is Alpha! Purchase it at \${{ cost }} </p>
</div>
`
}
]);

template$ = combineLatest([this.templates$, this.selectedTemplate$]).pipe(
map(
([templates, selected]) =>
templates.find(({ id }) => id == Number(selected)).value
)
);
templateString$ = combineLatest([this.templatingInfo$, this.template$]).pipe(
map(([info, template]) =>
Object.entries(info).reduce(
(prev, next) =>
prev
.toString()
.replace(new RegExp(`{{\\s${next[0]}\\s}}`), next[1].toString()),
template
)
),
map(template => this._sanitizer.bypassSecurityTrustHtml(template))
);
}


See Below Demo on Stackblitz
............................................................
You should load different components, rather than different templates. (it is still possible to apply different template for one component, but it is hard to do as well as it makes performance of your application worse, and also it harder to maintain. look for dynamic compilation if you still want this option)
you can register a set of components for example as some token and then show them
{
 provide: COMPONENTS_OF_CHOICE,
 multi: true,
 useValue: OneOfMyComponents
}

or
{
 provide: COMPONENTS_OF_CHOICE,
 useValue: [OneOfMyComponents, SecondOfMyComponents]
}

it is impossible to retrievethe ip and mac address of the device. it would be not secure and browser does not expose that data
............................................................

is it possible to load in html from either data in the database or
from HTML files.

Yes. You can for example create a ""template editor"" where the customer can build a template and you store that view in the database. It is not very simple but possible. You can extract the HTML from the database and display it e.g. via <div [innerHTML]=""data""></div>. You have to sanitze user input etc. though, because of injection security risks (xss). It might be better If you define a set of ""building blocks"" where the companies can combine multiple of those blocks into a template and you construct that UI dynamically (and do not store any inline HTML in the database).

is this possible by using any other library with Angular.

what kind of library, can you specify? Generally I dont see a problem why not.

is there a way to create an overview of templates that I offer to
companies that displays a preview of that template as well?

Yes. As mentioned above, if you store all templates in a database table e.g. templates you can query all templates (maybe with a key on the companyId) and show them with dummy data.

Is there a way to retrieve the ip and mac address of the device that
is displaying the template.

I dont know, but as @Andrei mentioned I suppose it is not possible.
............................................................
If I am getting you right, you want to create something like website builder platform for end users so that they can add their design.
If yes, I will say add some designs (by several component for a specific part) and give them choice to add that specific design which is already in your application.
This way you do not need to use innerHTML and will use angular security too.
By the way I dont think this question is related to angular. It should be part of your design
............................................................
From what I understand from the problem, You need customized templates for different companies but you are faced by risk of XSS attacks if you bind your templates to innerHTML and also large bundles that may lead to slow page loads.
This is How I would go about the problem

Define a Mixin that would hold general information about each company, for example if each template has groups and devices, we may have a mixin that looks like below

export type Constructor<T = {}> = new (...args: any[]) => T;
export const templateMixin = <T extends Constructor>(BaseClass: T = class { } as T) =>
class extends BaseClass {
devises$ = Observable<any[]>;
groups$ = Observable<any[]>;
data: any = { };
// All other variables and functions that may be common in template file
};


Create the templates as angular components... I know this sounds weird because of bundle size but we will solve this problem next

@Component({
selector: 'app-alpha-template',
template: `
`<div 
 [ngStyle]=""{'border-left':(tr.state=='busy')?'10px solid #D4061C':'10px solid #2CC52E'}"">
 {{data}}
</div>`
`,
styleUrls: ['./e-learning-edit-course.component.css']
})
export class AlphaTemplate extends templateMixin { };

The above is just an example, you may need a better naming style if you have more templates than the greek letters
Now we have solved the problem of XSS attacks. The next problem is bundle size

We note that different groups of individuals will load different templates, so the best approach would be to use lazy loading

You may define a route and set the children routes as the lazy loaded templateComponents

I am currently trying to figure out all the functions that my IDE has, and I have come across a predefined folder when I create a project that is called 'scratches and consoles'.
The IDE only allows me to create Scratch Files but I donÂ´t know what that kind of file is and what Is its purpose. Could someone give me a hand with this?

"	"
It's something like temporary notes with ability to highlight/format your code.

Sometimes you may need to create temporary notes or draft up some code outside of the project context. Instead of switching to a different application for this purpose, you can use scratch files and scratch buffers.

You can read more about it at JetBrains - Scratch files.

I am currently maintaining a project which is a large multi-language project including python, perl, bash and c/c++ languages. My current IDE is vim with YouCompleteMe plugin.
The problem of using this is that ycm more or less supports only one language for a project. Therefore, sometime when I encountered a c command called in a bash file, it took me a while to search what is the source code of such command, which I could not use goto functionality based on ycm.
I therefore wonder if there is a way to support such ""cross-reference intellisense"", e.g., I could goto a c or python command in a bash file ?
"	"
It is not very intelligent, but a tool like Universal Ctags, that supports dozens and dozens of languages, can be used to index your whole project and Vim's built-in tag-related commands can be used to jump to the definition of anything in any filetype as long as there is a tag for it.
See :help tags.

I'm not sure how it happened but a whole bunch of settings in my Eclipse java ide are messed up. I am assuming that this is also the reason why changing code while its running doesn't work anymore for me. When I run it in debug mode, change something and save it the changes are not happening in the program. I also dont get any warm messages if I do something that can't be changed while the code is running like adding a method or a field. Does anyone know what the problem is? I could probably reset all my settings but I also have some settings that I want to keep.

Two things to check:

Ensure that Build Automatically is selected under the Project menu; and
Make sure you're using Java version 1.4 or greater (Window menu > Preferences > Java > Installed JREs.

Can anybody tell me how to compile the opengl code in emacs just like we do in visual studio?
What we should do you link the library in emacs to run opengl code in emacs? Is it even possible? I've seen the internet that you can use emacs as you IDE although it is a text editor.
"	"
Emacs is just an editor. It doesn't give a iota about what you're writing in it. Sure you can loads a gazillion macros in it, and somewhere someone might have even created a Emacs Lisp implementation of OpenGL. But that's not relevant for this question.
What editor you use is completely irrelevent to programming OpenGL!
I think what you're really interested in is, how to write Makefiles or equivalent for other build systems.

You want to compile OpenGL code? Great! To do so in C or C++ include the OpenGL headers in your source code, i.e.
#if defined(__APPLE__)
#include <OpenGL/gl.h>
#else
#include <GL/gl.h>
#endif

For any other language use the appropriate bindings.
Then add the OpenGL to your linker:
For Windows:

Visual C++: Add opengl32.lib to the list of extra libraries
MinGW / GCC / Clang: Add -lopengl32 to the linker stage

For Linux:

If linking for GLvnd (recommended): Add -lOpenGL to the linker stage
If not using GLvnd: Add -lGL to the linker stage

For macOS: Add -framework OpenGL to the compiler and linker stages.

It must have been a simple edit in white space or something...

Use the history button on the bottom right of the editor window.
Then click on differences button at the bottom right side and select two versions you want to compare. Probably the ""buffer"" which is what you see in the editor and another file you saved before (You have data and time). The number of files in the history can be changed with one of Delphi option.
Then in the bottom part of the window, you see the first difference. Use the Shift+Ctrl+F8 to skip to next difference (Shift+Ctrl+F7 for previous).

I need to edit upwards of 100+ queries stored in .properties for a Java app. I currently use Notepad++ to open up and edit the queries before practicing running them. This workflow is not working out because Notepad++ even with SQL language selected doesn't alert me about missing (), missing commas, or a missing \ at the end.
The queries are formatted initially as:
supply_items=select item,date,sum(case when (color='orange' or color='red') then 0 else 1) /
from table /
where year = ? and /
month = ? 

I copy paste it out into PGAdmin and run it as a SQL query that will pass compilation:
select item,date,sum(case when (color='orange' or color='red') then 0 else 1) 
from table 
where year = '2019' and 
month = 'January 

Then I edit it for the data fix and correspondingly edit the .properties file.
The problem I'm encountering is I'll make small syntactical mistakes at the point where I copy back in the good query and reformat it. For instance, I'll copy this back in:
supply_items=select item,date,sum(case when (color='orange' or color='red') / then 0 else 2 
from table /
where year = ? /
month = ? 

There is a / at the wrong place in line 1, a missing ) at line 2, and a missing and at line 4. But a readthru doesn't catch it for me when I'm editing 100+ at a time.
I'm on a data team, so the dev team is responsible for building and testing. I would build and test on my own, as that would easily point me to the issues, but my team is against that idea. I've thought about writing a script to pass in all the queries and test for syntactical correctness, but I wouldn't be sure where to get started (eg. a common library for reading .properties queries this way). I'm also open to an IDE that would be able to highlight errors from a .properties ruleset.
"	"
I gave this issue some more thinking and came up with two solutions:

Write a script that reads and ""unit tests"" the queries in the .properties file. I did this in python for fast setup, with pyjavaproperties. sqlite already had an API solution to pass in paramters to queries with ?'s, so I used that.

Use git diff. I realized that if I committed the new queries that were all but syntactically correct, diff would alert me to format changes (or at least areas where there could be format changes, and I could see the original to compare). Git bash isn't well suited for this so I chose diffmerge as my UI.

Try something like this. Be aware of fact that you maybe need to navigate to your link, because I cant see more of your HTML so I do not now is it uniqe.
//*a[starts-with(@herf, 'sometext') and ends-with(@herf, '123456')]

............................................................
This is the solution
xpath=//div/a[@href='/play.php?video=123456']

The pluggins I'm currently using are JBoss Tools, Spring STS, Subeclipse and Dark Theme.
I've tried to download the whole IDE again and to uncheck most of the options regarding validations, to no avail. Any ideas?
Thank you very much!!

Go to Windows -> Preferences -> Language servers. Disable all checkboxes, apply & close. Restart IDE. It solved problem for me.
............................................................
In my case it was ""Camel LSP server for java"", in Language Servers. After disabling it, the GUI become responsive again

I have noticed that in IntelliJ there is some kind of diff tool

Unfortunately, this kind of instrument seems only to show differences between common files

I think it should be more useful something that shows also the files present on one commit but not in the other, and vice versa, like ""diff"" function between normal commits. I have tried to select inner folders for compare, but nothing. Do you know at least any workaround?
"	"
For now, the only possible solution is to raise the problem to Jetbrains, and wait.
Please upvote the ticket if you want it implemented.

My Previous Question + More

I am trying to start learning Kotlin, and I have installed IntelliJ Idea from JetBrains, I really like the layout of the IDE, and so I don't really want to change it.
Whenever I try to run the program, I get the following error:
Could not open init generic class cache for initialization script 'C:\Users\Jacob\AppData\Local\Temp\wrapper_init1.gradle' (C:\Users\Jacob\.gradle\caches\6.6.1\scripts\9x7j38tmeo1ohlyu8452ntfdm).
> BUG! exception in phase 'semantic analysis' in source unit '_BuildScript_' Unsupported class file major version 60

I know it's not the code, and since I am not very familiar with IntelliJ Idea or Kotlin, I have no idea where to start looking for the error or where to fix it...

Someone said that this question's answers were the solution, but I looked their, tried what it shows, but still found now solution for my situation... When I follow what they say, I get the same error.
Someone please help!!! ðŸ˜�

I created instruction:

Install JDK (for example Oracle JDK 14)

Open project folder with build.gradle and settings.gradle in Idea

Add JDK to project: press F4 on left Project Tool -> SDk -> Add -> Apply


Set new SDK to project: press F4 on left Project Tool -> Project -> Project SDK -> Set new SDK -> OK


Set new SDK to Gradle Build Tool: press Ctrl + Alt + S -> Find gradle in search -> Go to Gradle JVM -> Set new SDK -> OK


Create new directory src/main/kotlin/main.kt with code


fun main() {
val jdk = System.getProperty(""java.version"")
println(""Using JDK: $jdk"")
}


Go to main.kt in Editor and press Ctrl + Shift + F10 and you must see your JDK version in console like: Using JDK: 14.0.2

Take a look sample project

I'm trying to generate calling graph with which to find out all the possible execution paths that are hitting a particular function (so that I don't have to figure out all the paths manually, as there are many paths that lead to this function). For instance:

path 1: A -> B -> C -> D
path 2: A -> B -> X -> Y -> D
path 3: A -> G -> M -> N -> O -> P -> S -> D
...
path n: ...


I have tried Codeviz and Doxygen, somehow both results show nothing but callees of target function, D. In my case, D is a member function of a class whose object will be wrapped within a smart pointer. Clients will always obtain the smart pointer object through a factory in order to invoke D.

Does anyone know how to achieve this?
"	"
static void D() { }
static void Y() { D(); }
static void X() { Y(); }
static void C() { D(); X(); }
static void B() { C(); }
static void S() { D(); }
static void P() { S(); }
static void O() { P(); }
static void N() { O(); }
static void M() { N(); }
static void G() { M(); }
static void A() { B(); G(); }

int main() {
A();
}


Then

$ clang++ -S -emit-llvm main1.cpp -o - | opt -analyze -dot-callgraph
$ dot -Tpng -ocallgraph.png callgraph.dot


Yields some shiny picture (there is an ""external node"", because main has external linkage and might be called from outside that translation unit too):



You may want to postprocess this with c++filt, so that you can get the unmangled names of the functions and classes involved. Like in the following

#include <vector>

struct A { 
A(int);
void f(); // not defined, prevents inlining it!
};

int main() {
std::vector<A> v;
v.push_back(42);
v[0].f();
}

$ clang++ -S -emit-llvm main1.cpp -o - |
 opt -analyze -std-link-opts -dot-callgraph
$ cat callgraph.dot | 
 c++filt | 
 sed 's,>,\\>,g; s,-\\>,->,g; s,<,\\<,g' | 
 gawk '/external node/{id=$1} $1 != id' | 
 dot -Tpng -ocallgraph.png


Yields this beauty (oh my, the size without optimizations turned on was too big!)



That mystical unnamed function, Node0x884c4e0, is a placeholder assumed to be called by any function whose definition is not known.
............................................................
You can achieve that by using doxygen (with option to use dot for graphs generation).



With Johannes Schaub - litb main.cpp, it generates this:



doxygen/dot are probably easier than clang/opt to install and run. I did not manage to install it myself and that's why I tried to find an alternative solution!
............................................................
Statically computing an accurate C++ call graph is hard, because you need a precise langauge parser, correct name lookup, and a good points-to analyzer that honors the language semantics properly.Doxygen doesn't have any of these, I don't know why people claim to like it for C++; it is easy to construct a 10 line C++ example that Doxygen erroneously analyzes).
You might be better off running a timing profiler which collects a call graph dynamically (this describes ours) and simply exercise a lot of cases.Such profilers will show you the actual call graph exercised.
EDIT: I suddenly rememberedUnderstand for C++, which claims to construct call graphs.I don't know what they use for a parser, or whether they do the detailed analysis right; I have very little specific experience with their product.My few encounters suggests it does not do points-to analysis.
I am impressed by Schaub's answer, using Clang; I would expect Clang to have all the elements right.
............................................................
You can use CppDepend, it can generatesmany kinds of graphs


Dependency Graph
Call Graph
Class Inheritance Graph
Coupling Graph
Path Graph
All Paths Graph
Cycle Graph



............................................................
In order for the clang++ command to find standard header files like mpi.h two additional options should be used -### -fsyntax-only, i.e. the full command should look as:

clang++ -### -fsyntax-only -S -emit-llvm main1.cpp -o - | opt -analyze -dot-callgraph

............................................................
The ""C++ Bsc Analyzer"" can display call graphs - by reading the file generated by the bscmake utility.
............................................................
doxygen + graphviz could solve most problems when we wanna generate call graph,next handed to manpower.
............................................................
Scitools Understand is a fantastic tool, better than everything I know for reverse engineering, and generates high quality graphs.

But note it is quite expensive and that the trial version has its butterfly call graph limited to only one level of call (IMHO I believe they don't help themselves doing soâ€?

I am testing/learning webhook. How to send, receive it. So I thought I would use GAS.
I have this simple script and I wonder why Logger does not work. In Projects/Executions I can see that the script doPost was executed but no logs. Email was sent and the script returned the value.

using old, Legacy Editor (no idea how to get the new one)
in Menu-Resources-Cloud Platform Project is said ""This script has an Apps Script-managed Cloud Platform project.""
when I open the project in editor I get this message ""This project is running on our new Apps Script runtime powered by Chrome V8.""
exception logging set to ""exceptionLogging"": ""STACKDRIVER"" is set to default

I tried console.log(e); but it did not work for me.
function doPost(e) {

 Logger.log(""I was called"")
 if(typeof e !== 'undefined'){

Logger.log(e.parameter);
Logger.log(""I was called 2"")
 
MailApp.sendEmail({
 to: ""radek@gmail.com"",
 subject: ""Call Sucessful"",
 htmlBody: ""I am your <br>"" +
 JSON.stringify(e)+ ""<br><br>"" +
 JSON.stringify(e.parameters)

});

}
return ContentService.createTextOutput(JSON.stringify(e))
}

Question1: Can I make Logger work?
Question2: I would like to see accepted data in Debugger, is that possible?
Question3: Is there any way the GAS pushes the data it received to my web browser. Of course the browser is NOT sending the data.
Question4: No related to the topic but ... Would you know what I need to do in order to be able to use new Editor?

If you want your own custom log information to go to Stackdriver, then you need to create a Google Cloud Platform project, and associate that GCP project with your Apps Script project.
First create a new GCP Project:
Go to your GCP dashboard:
https://console.cloud.google.com/home/dashboard?authuser=0
In the blue bar at the top, there is a drop down menu for project names.Click that, and a dialog should appear with a button to create a new project.
Create a new Google Cloud Platform project.
Copy the Project Number.
Go back to the Apps Script editor.
From the legacy Apps Script editor, click the ""Resources"" menu.
Click Cloud Platform project.
Paste in the Project Number and click the button.
Now, any console.log() statements you have will send the logs to Stackdriver.
And Stackdriver can be viewed in your browser.
Note: Some people set up their own logging system to log information from server side Apps Script code to a Google Sheet.There are some open source repos that are available.
The new code editor does have a ""built-in"" way to log server side information to a log pane code editor window.But, of course this assumes that you are running code from the code editor.This new feature avoids the need for changing browser tabs to see your logging output.I don't know of any way to log server side info to your browser console.You could save log info into an object, and then send it back to the client after the server code completed, and then log everything in the console.
The way that it might be possible to get logging information depends on how the code was originally triggered.

From code editor
From a user using your app
From a Http Request to your Web App

Logging in Apps Script works differently depending upon:

run time version being used - V8 or DEPRECATED_ES5 - Set in appsscript.json file or through the ""Run"" menu in the Legacy editor, Set in ""Settings"" in new IDE - New Apps Script projects default to V8 so chances are your project is using V8.
Is your Apps Script project associated with a Google Cloud Platform
(GCP) default or standard project
Is exception logging set to ""exceptionLogging"": ""STACKDRIVER"" - Set in appsscript.json file - Default is always to include it - Probably already correct unless you deleted it.
Using either Logger.log or console.log
Using console.log in the server "".gs"" file or client side "".html""
file.console.log can be used in both server and client side code
but the log print out goes to different places.You can't see logs
in the browser dev tools from a console.log statement in your
server code.If you use console.log in server side .gs files, and the Apps Script project is not associated with a standard GCP project, then the log only gets sent to your ""Executions.""I believe that the only way that you can get your logs sent to Stackdriver is by using a standard GCP project.The problem with that, is that you only have so many GCP projects that you can use without requesting an increase in your quota.

Plus there may be issues (bugs) depending upon how you have logging set up and other factors.
For example:
https://issuetracker.google.com/issues/134374008
............................................................
As lots of people specified, you can use console.log for this.
However, I also work with webhooks from time to time. And I find it much more comfortable to debug directly into google spreadsheets, using code like this
function doPost(e) {
log('# doPost', JSON.stringify(e));
try {
// Some webhook-processing logic here
if(e.parameter.action == 'test-error') {
item.something = nothing;
}
if(e.parameter.action == 'test-log') {
log('# custom log', 'Some data');
}
} catch(error) {
log('# error', JSON.stringify([error, error.stack]));
}
}

function log(event, message){
SpreadsheetApp.getActive().getSheetByName('Log').appendRow([new Date(), event, message])
}

Example spreadsheet:
https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/144i9pxDIB_C8ZRZ-6vd9DiPIw8Rt85hTtVoqk7dtHQg/edit?usp=sharing
You can trigger logging by something like this
curl -X POST https://script.google.com/macros/s/AKfycby3EoaQ8DOt8H_Mc4vjH6JZkhsaAwYHk_sa9HE5Be3qVo0Ym0b2/exec?action=test-error

or
curl -X POST https://script.google.com/macros/s/AKfycby3EoaQ8DOt8H_Mc4vjH6JZkhsaAwYHk_sa9HE5Be3qVo0Ym0b2/exec?action=test-log

You can use same log for your custom logging of some intermediate variable during webhook resolution.
The reason I prefer this over standard stackdriver logging is that google sheets are more explicit and easier to manage.
............................................................
You can use console.log() to see things within ""My Executions"".

On line 11 the foo() method is called and beside the parameter value it shows the parameter name which i don't want and also there is a weird pink box along with the parameter name. How do i get rid of this. Tried many things on settings and found no solution. Any help is appreciated.

In menu:
View | Show Inline Hints
............................................................
These are 2 separate things:

(1) Inline Hints
In NetBeans 12.2 (and I am I assuming it's the same for your version) there is an option from the main menu:
View > Show Inline Hints

This causes those items in a smaller font to be displayed/hidden, such as your data: hint.

(2) Autocompletion Hints
The red/pink borders are related to text which has been auto-completed for you by NetBeans. I believe if you just type somewhere else then that border disappears (because you have implicitly ""accepted"" the autocomplete suggestion).

I want to ask about the best IDE to prototype programs by using OpenCV library.
Iâ€™ve been programming with Halcon for 3 years and I would like to learn how to program with OpenCV too. I was thinking about reproducing some old programs that I have created with Halcon, but instead using OpenCV. The problem is that maybe Iâ€™m not using the correct IDE (Iâ€™m programming with Python using Spyder) or maybe programming with OpenCV is slower than I have expected (I don't discard the possibility that I donâ€™t know the appropriate way to prototype properly by using these tools).
I already know I come from an expensive program that allows me to work with many comforts, but I miss having a window where I can display dynamically the results of the operations than Iâ€™m applying. Also, draw some ROIs quickly. Anyways, do you think Iâ€™m using the right tools? Do you know some tutorials from which I can learn how to prototype quickly using that IDE?
Thank you in advance!

My suggestion for OpenCV prototyping in a GUI is a program called GRIP (Graphically Represented Image Pipeline). You can download it from GitHub.
It supports many inputs: single image, multiple images, webcam, and even HTTP cameras. You get all the key OpenCV commands, along with some custom ones developed by WPI. 

You develop your image processing flow as a pipeline, with filtering blocks such as desaturate, find contours, etc. in which you string the output from one block to the input of another (or multiple). You can then export the pipeline to Python, Java, or C++ (exported as a usable class with a key process function). If you want to see an example, feel free to check out this previous post I wrote!

The are many things I like about the new Apps Script IDE. But in the old IDE I used to be able to invoke the find dialog box to search for a function or variable name and the dialog box would return a list of files it was found in.
In the new IDE I can only search the active file on the window.
For example; In this case I referred to a function my JS file and the dialog box listed the files containing that function or variable name. This greatly reduces the time spent looking for the function when you have hundreds if not thousands of functions and files.

Is there a way to search all files in the new IDE?
Thank you
"	"

Right click on the variable/function name you want to search for references:




2a. Left click on Peek Definition (or press Alt + F12) if you want to see all the function declarations of the selected name:


2b. Left click on Peek References if you want to see all the declarations (functions and variables) of the selected name:


Please note:

The pop up window directs you to the reference scripts so you can edit them inside that window.

Click on the Esc button if you want to escape the pop up window.

I am working on a Gradle project where some of the tests occasionally fail sporadically due to reasons unrelated to their correctness (specifically, sometimes the Testcontainers Docker containers fail to start up).This is mitigated using the Test Retry Gradle Plugin to retry tests on failure, which greatly reduces the chances of such a build failure occurring.
plugins {
id 'java'
id 'org.gradle.test-retry' version '1.2.0'
}

dependencies {
testImplementation platform('org.junit:junit-bom:5.7.1')
testImplementation 'org.junit.jupiter:junit-jupiter'
}

test {
useJUnitPlatform()

retry {
maxRetries = 1
}
}

One annoyance with this setup occurs when running individual tests/test classes from the IntelliJ IDEA IDE using the default ""Run tests using: Gradle"" configuration.
When testing code under development from IDEA, failed tests are far more likely to indicate an issue with the in-progress code changes.Flaky test failures are far rarer, since only a small number of tests are being run.Flaky test failures are also obvious when they do occur, and less problematic since it's the result of a manual user interaction.
The downsides of retrying tests are that some of the tests take a while to run, and retrying tests in the IDE gives a false sense of how many tests have passed/failed.For these reasons, I do not want failed tests to be retried when individual tests are run from IDEA.
How can I configure my Gradle project to retry when run from the console, but not from within IntelliJ IDEA?Bonus points if the solution also works for other Java IDEs (e.g. Eclipse & NetBeans), but a solution that only works for IDEA will suffice.
"	"
The idea.active system property can be checked for a value of ""true"", customizing the configuration based on whether it's set:
test {
useJUnitPlatform()

if (System.getProperty('idea.active') != 'true') {
retry {
maxRetries = 1
}
}
}

I'm not sure whether or where this property is documented, but I have confirmed that it works for the latest version of IDEA (IDEA Ultimate 2020.3.2).

When I write a hex value in my VB.NET code, I want it to look like this:
&H0F (Binary: &B00001111)
but instead, Visual Studio makes it (imo) unreadable by removing the leading 0's:
&HF (Binary: &B1111)
That way, I cant see easily whether it's a byte, a short, etc.
So my question is: Is there a setting in the Visual Studio IDE that disables this ""feature""?
I really want to keep those 0's.
Thank you in advance!
"	"
In VS2017 and above: if you use the group separator _ (underscore character),the leading zeros will not be removed by the editor. See: Hexadecimal, binary, and octal literals
Note that the group separator adds no intrinsic meaning to value; they are just meaningless formatting characters . What I mean by that is that only the digits are preserved when it is evaluated by the parser.Think of it as all ""_"" are removed from the string before evaluating. So, &B1_1_1_1 is the same as &B1________________1_1_1.
Some Examples:
Dim b As Byte
b = &B0000_1111
b = &B0_0_0_0_1_1_1_1
b = &H0_F

For some reason I cannot choose C++ language standard in Visual Studio. By saying that I mean next thing:
I can go to the properties and choose the language standard but Visual Studio doesnt see that. How did I came to that: I tried to include filesystem header with setting the C++17 standard setbut then I saw that filesystem is not a member of std namespace: 
First, I thought that it was not an C++17 standard so I double checked that. After me checking all the stuff again I decided to go to the header file and check the stuff going wrong. I saw that _HAS_CXX17 is disabled although in properties C++17 is set: 
I have no additional libraries connected in properties and this version of Visual studio has to be working with all of that C++17 headers because I had to work with them and still can compile these projects I've been working on, but I can't switch standard on any project now. No library were installed during period it were working last time. I updated Visual studio recently but it didnt help althought on other PC everything is working perfectly.

I am simply adding the answer from the comments above since this helped me as well. Credit goes to Ted Lyngmo.
When changing properties, make sure either that the properties editing window is set to all configurations, or at least matches your current configuration (i. e., if you are on Debug x64, make sure those are the properties you are editing for). But if you want the property to be applied for all configurations, select All configurations on the properties editor.

When using ANTLR 4 to process a grammar against input text, we must specify the starting rule within that grammar.
I have forgotten how to specify the start rule when using the ANTLR v4 plugin for IntelliJ IDE. So when I type in some input, the plugin displays in the Parse tree pane the error message No-start-rule-is-selected. Another error message in red is displayed on the left pane for Input / File options.

"	"

Context-click on your desired rule within the grammar source file.
Choose Test Rule menu item.

The pluginâ€™s panes then interactively reacts to your input text. As you type or paste in text, the selected rule and further rules are instantly updated to generate the Parse tree & Hierarchy panesâ€?content.
Let's click on that rule r : ""hello"" ID ; shown in your Questionâ€™s screen shot. Select the item Test Rule r. See the red message Hello.g4 start rule: <select from navigator or grammar> disappear. And see the Parse tree appear.

This behavior is mentioned briefly on the pluginâ€™s home page. But you must click the tiny moreâ€?blue link text to reveal this verbiage.

Right click on rule and say ""Test ANTLR Rule"".

Also noted briefly on the ReadMe page on GitHub site for the open-source project.

One method you could follow is, If you have maven,convert your project as maven and add all the atrifactIds of libs/jars you want to compile with your code in pom.xml.Then you can use ""mvn clean install"" from your machine.

I need to detect via xpath an element (image with href) but i know a part of href only

I tried this xpath that recognize element with a part of href but working in text link only
xpath=//a[contains(@href, ""123456"")]

How can i detect the element using a part of href only ?
I need xpath only please.
"	"
You need get /img in //a where href attribute contains() or ends-with() your id
This is XPATH that you need. At least i would use this XPATH in this situation
//a[ends-with(@href, 'your-id-here')]/img

............................................................
You can use regular expresions. Something like
driver.find_element_by_xpath(""//input[starts-with (@name,'Tut')]"")
or as you described
driver.find_element_by_xpath(""//input[contains(@name,'sel')]"").
Be awere of one thing, do not use double quotes, for the string you are searching as atribute value. Use a single quote like I previously described.

Java file is not analyzed since it's located outside of the source root. You need to either relocate the file or reconfigure your content roots so that it resides under the folder configured as the Sources root.

This is finally what worked for me! Phew!
My Problem: Whenever I exit Intellij and try to open up an old/existing project, I have trouble getting the builds and execute to work on my localhost. I'm just using localhost.

Here are the steps that finally worked on my localhost environment:

1. Go to Project Structure and Select Project 

a. Set the SDK to 10 (â€œJava Version 10.0.2â€? or whatever you are using.

b. (I think this was the main step I was missing) Set the project compiler output to point to where I want the compiled output to sit: C:\Users\kbala\OneDrive - MatrixCare\SoftWLearnings\Javamyfun\NewHelloWorld\out

c. Project Language Level: I chose â€œSDK Defaultâ€?
2. Go to Project Structure and Select Modules

a. Click on src (this is where my source code sits). 

b. Then, Click on the â€œSourcesâ€?folder icon on the top. This adds src to the â€œSource foldersâ€?on the right. You will see the color change to Blue 

c. Click ok. 

3. Then, click on â€œAdd Configurationâ€?(top right corner of Intellij)

a. Select + at the top left hand corner.

b. Select â€œApplicationâ€?
c. Change the name to â€œMainâ€?
d. Now click on the Ellipsis (three dots) in â€œMain Classâ€? You should now see your Main Class. Select it. 

e. You should now see the execute arrow at that top right of Intellij. And you should see the build icon (Hammer). 

This should work!

If you use a build system (Maven, Gradle, etc.):
Open its panel in IntelliJ, then click the reimport button. For Gradle, this button looks like a sync icon and its hovertext says ""Reload All Gradle Projects"".
Why it works:
Since the build system is in charge of compiling your code, it knows which files are source code. It would be a waste of computing power to look for missing semicolons in a compiled binary file, so IntelliJ won't try to find errors until it knows the file is source code.
Most build systems, Maven and Gradle included, are also dependency managers. When you write code that uses libraries or depends on a different module, IntelliJ needs to be able to understand the dependency to tell you whether your code makes sense, or whether you made a mistake like forgetting an import statement or passing the wrong type of argument into a library function. When IntelliJ doesn't understand your dependencies, it displays all your uses of imported code in red text.
............................................................
I was getting the same issue, I just clicked on the re-import button on the maven panel and it solved the problem .
............................................................
I had the same issue and here it is how I solved it:
Some files where ignored and I Unignored them. To do this go to Maven tab on the right panel -> right click on each project that is in grey color and click Unignore projects.
............................................................
I'll add an another reason for it. For me it was Reader mode enabled. I was not even been aware of its existence. Can be disabled in Settings -> Editor -> Reader mode.

I'm having an issue where my build.sbt file is not being picked up properly using IntelliJ (Ultimate 2020.2.3). I create a new Scala sbt project using the IntelliJ wizard (file > new > project > scala / sbt) and add a new dependancy to the buid.sbt file but when I try to import it into one of my class files, IntelliJ will not compile my project due to a dependancy issue.
The sbt tool window picks up the external dependancies but my project ""external dependancies"" doesn't contain the library at all, even after I refresh the project. Also, my build.sbt file has a bunch of errors in it like it's not being recognised properly by IntelliJ but I've installed the Scala plugin so I don't know what else I could do?
Here you can see that I've added the org.slf4j dependancy into my build.sbt; It's picked up by the sbt tool window (on the right) but not by my project (on the left)

When I hover over the libraryDependencies in the build.sbt file it doesn't seem to recognise the sbt syntax:

I cannot import the library into my class file and the project wont build:

I'm new to Scala and I'm simply trying to create a basic hello world project but I can't seem to get past this frustrating issue.
"	"
You can try first to create an SBT project manually in some directory. build.sbt alone would be enough.
Then run sbt in that directory to see that SBT shell works properly. Try some commands like sbt compile, sbt run with some helloworld app. When you create helloworld app mind the directory structure where you put it, i.e.: src/main/scala/HelloWorld.scala.
If all that works go to IntelliJ and import/open project from there - select build.sbt.
When you create or import SBT project from IntelliJ it takes a while to bootstrap everything and download compiler, etc. Just leave it until it's done. Same goes for first time compilation when the compiler needs to be compiled :).
To setup a sample project you can issue these shell commands:
mkdir untitled
cd untitled/

echo 'name := ""untitled""

version := ""0.1""

scalaVersion := ""2.13.3""

libraryDependencies ++= Seq(
""org.slf4j"" % ""slf4j-simple"" % ""1.7.26"",
)
' > build.sbt

mkdir -p src/main/scala/

echo 'object HelloWorld {
def main(args: Array[String]): Unit = {
println(""Hello World"")
}
}
' > src/main/scala/HelloWorld.scala

sbt run

If there are not issues with these steps then import build.sbt into IntelliJ.
............................................................
I was finally able to get past this issue. I'm not 100% sure what solved it in the end unfortunately but disabling a bunch of plugins I wasn't using seemed to fix the issue for me.
I suspect it may have been the Gradle plugin since I saw some errors in the idea.log file but after re-enabling the Gradle plugin to test everything is still working so not sure.

I am developing a QT GUI for my application using QT Creator (4.11.0).
Recently, our IT updated my OS to Ubuntu 20.04 (from 18.04) - maybe the error is related to that.
I have not touched to project in some month but yesterday wanted to continue developing it.
However, within the IDE there are now thousands of errors highlighted at almost every line of my code. (with highlighted I mean that there is this red background and a red dot beside the line number)
On the very top, it says:
Warning: The code model could not parse an included file, which might lead to incorrect code completion and highlighting, for example.
cstddef:50:10: fatal error: 'stddef.h' file not found
...

The errors that are listed in the IDE are very wired like:
type `QMainWindow`is not a direct or virtual base of `MainWindow` (my class is called `MainWindow`)

I'm pretty sure it is not related to my code:

the code compiles and works fine - it is really just the IDE that is highlighting errors at every line of my code.
I have the same code on a Windows Computer and there no errors are listed in the IDE.
even if I start a brand new QT Widget project the errors appear within the template code provided by the QT Creator.

Since the GCC version changed with the update of the OS, I thought maybe I have to define a new KIT but this also did not help.
Is there anything I can do to fix the issue?
Do I have to reinstall the QT Creator?
I know, pictures are not very well-liked but here I think it might help to understand what I mean with ""IDE is highlighting errors"":

When editing the following:

My python IDE reported

The problem is that fflistline.split is assigning the function fflistline.split to line_ar and not calling the function fflistline.split() and assigning that list to line_ar.
I took turns staring at that and searching for that error message for 10 minutesbefore I took a break and I still had to work on something else for a while before the missing empty () flashed in to my brain.Maybe IDE's should come with a setting that warns about this.If I had typed it in directly it would have autocompleted the () so I guess it must have been a cut and paste or an edit error somewhere...

Honestly you don't even need to know these menu names (maybe except the editor).

I've just made QueryBook, the Pinterest Query IDE. I've played around with the demo environment and now I want to see if I can connect up one of our own environments to play with purpose. I can't for the life of me figure out how to create a new environment. Any ideas? ""/"" defaults back to the demo environment and any other address (it's running on localhost) 404s.
I've clicked on everything that looks clickable. I don't have enough StackOverflow rep to create the tag ""querybook"" for this question and it also looks like the screenshot below is having issues. It's obviously a Monday kind of Wednesday.

Okay, found it. Go to Settings -> Admin Tools

I compile a linux network project with cygwin32 on win10.
The reason for doing this is that I can use comfortable IDE coding envrionment and donot need switch to linux environment to do real-time compilation.
Cygwin shows non-found file error.
fatal error: sys/epoll.h: No such file or directory
6 | #include <sys/epoll.h>

Does this mean epoll is something only available in the linux 2.6 kernel?
Cygwin has most but not all linux feature?
"	"
The file is not available on any Cygwin package
$ cygcheck -p sys/epoll.h
Found 0 matches for sys/epoll.h

Cygwin can emulate most of the Linux user space, but it is NOT an exact replica, and it
is limited on the underlying Microsoft engine for some feature

I have a simple question - what is a difference between open project and import existing project into workspace in Eclipse?
"	"
Open Project opens a closed project that is already in the current workspace. It is only useful if you actually close projects - personally I always leave them all open.
Import Existing Project imports a project from some other workspace and adds it to the current workspace. You can choose to copy everything in the project in to the workspace which makes it completely independent of the original project location, or you can leave the project pointing to original location.
Some versions of Eclipse also have a 'Open Projects from File System...' menu item which is variant of the Import Existing Projects but supports finding projects in a directory or archive (jar or zip). This will try and guess the project type even without the .project file that identifies an Eclipse project and is required for Import Existing Projects.

I am using VS Code to write some HTML. I noticed that the IDE will auto-insert some code for me. For example, if I want a <p> tag, VS Code will create <p></p> for me and the cursor will land in the middle (between the opening and closing paragraph tags). However, when I am done typing the content inside the <p> tags, typically, I use my mouse or the directional right-arrow to move to the end. Is there a way to not move my fingers from the typing positions (e.g. fdsa and jkl;) to go to the end of the line or tag, or would I always have to use the mouse or directional pad?
I find IDEs like what JetBrains provide do not have this limitation for certain languages. For example, in Python, if I want to print something using PyCharm, I can type (the closing single quote and right parenthesis are auto-added)
print('')

My cursor will land inside the single quotes. To simply get outside the closing parenthesis, I simply type in ' followed by ) and the IDE is smart enough to know to not place the single quote and closing parenthesis there (it's like using the right arrow twice to get outside the print statement).
WebStorm, like VS Code, has the ""problem"" when dealing with HTML. If I am inside an opening and closing <p> tag, and right next to the closing one </p>, simply typing <, /, p, > will not land me outside (as with Python and PyCharm). On Windows, I can press the End key or on Mac I can press fn+right to get to the end; but that requires breaking the flow and continuity of my hands in the typing positions (eyes have to be redirected too).
Any tips on how to be a more productive coder using VS Code or other modern IDEs with HTML? Are there plugins that we may use to address this problem?
"	"
I often just use <CTRL> + â†?(right arrow) a few times to quickly navigate past words and code blocks. It won't immediately get you to the end but if there isn't a ton of code after your current cursor location, a few quick uses of this keystroke can be faster than lifting your hands and checking with eyes to find thekey.
Depending on what your keyboard layout is, this could be faster. Personally, if it's a big issue, I would second other posters here and add a custom keybind / hotkey to a lesser-used key nearby.
//Begin CAVEAT
I'm not mentioning just using the <END> key here as a solution purposefully, since you indicated that using that using keys too far from home row broke your flow. Depending on my keyboard layout, that is often the fastest option by far, however my current keyboard makes that a non-starter.
Part of the issue here is that people's experience is so different based on what keyboard they're using, as well as hand size and dexterity. YMMV with any solutions we mention that isn't a custom keybind.
//END CAVEAT
............................................................
I believe the default is ctrl + e. I don't recall changing it in my keybindings, but maybe I did. Regardless you can set it to what ever you want. It's named cursorLineEnd

............................................................
You can paste this code in your keybindings.json file in vs code

ctrl+RightArrow....>>> for Move cursor to Line end
ctrl+LeftArrow ....>>> for Move cursor to Line start
alt+RightArrow.....>>> for moving cursor word by word
alt+LeftArrow....>>> for moving cursor word by word

Just paste this code into your keybindings.json in vs code
[
{
""key"": ""alt+right"",
""command"": ""cursorWordEndRight"",
""when"": ""textInputFocus && !accessibilityModeEnabled""
},
{
""key"": ""alt+left"",
""command"": ""cursorWordEndLeft"",
""when"": ""textInputFocus && !accessibilityModeEnabled""
},
{
""key"": ""ctrl+right"",
""command"": ""cursorLineEnd""
},
{
""key"": ""ctrl+left"",
""command"": ""cursorLineStart""
},
]

Make sure to adjust commas and brackets, if there is already some code.
............................................................
Cmd + Right

This will go to the end of you current line.
Tips:

Hold down shift to start a selection
Use Alt or Ctrl instead of Cmd to change the distance the cursor travels

............................................................
I'm not sure which OS you specifically use being that you mentioned but an OS agnostic approach is to create your own keybind / key chord (sequence).
A key chord is essentially a way to use another 'layer' of key shortcuts, if you use your imagination for lingo. To illustrate: consider CTRL + Sis a keyboard shortcut. Now consider CRTL + K chord CTRL + S, which is a completely different shortcut even though you use the same sequence.
Consider an edit/insert mode
I don't use vim, nor have I ever tried, but I really find value in the idea of having different 'modes', one visual one for insert and edit. Personally, I have elected CTRL + E to be my chord sequence for 'edit mode'. Now, every single key and sequence of keys becomes a brand new possability. Why CTRL + E? Well 'e' for edit, naturally, but also because it is default duplicate; for whatever reason vscode identifies this shortcut to be the same as CTRL + P by default.
I then use $ to go to the end of the line and ^ to the beginning, arbitrarily because of regex, but the point is you can create your own according to your own preference, which appears to be that of the home row. So if you elect to go this approach you can use j if you want. If you were to argue this is too much user input for a single action, consider the position of using a PC at home and a mac at work, as I do, you would already be comfortable with your settings and not need to 're-learn' shortcuts.
This answer uses an approach that affords you the creative freedom to define what a 'productive coder' looks like for you, provides a different approach to going to the end of line while maintaining your home row position, and hopefully demonstrates to any new vscoders that you are not bound to just using the native CTRL + K sequence as the chord identifier.
Regardless, re:

without using ... some key combinations?

That's unavoidable, I think, unless you choose to remap normal typing keys for this purpose
............................................................
Change the key binding for cursor down to Shift + Space. I didn't remap right Arrow for reasons I'll explain shortly, but I could have easily done that as well.
When I code, I like to use indented formatting. So, when I type <p> and </p> is automatically generated, I go one step further and press ENTER. By default, that causes </p> to move to the same indention level as <p> on the line below my cursor, and puts my cursor on an indented line below <p>. Gif for reference:
Shortcut to make an indented block:

That leaves my fingers basically on the home keys, because when I'm done in that level, I'll press Shift + Space to go to the line below, where the ending tag will be, and then I can press ENTER a couple times as normal and create a new tag or whatever else I'll be adding to the file.
If you would like to set up your key bindings like mine, or do something slightly different, here is what I did:

Ctrl + K Ctrl + S (to open key bindings)
Search for ""cursorDown""
Highlight the row and press ENTER
Press Shift + Space

............................................................
If you like to stick to the home row and do not want to use arrow keys,
you can customize your keyboard shortcuts.
paste the below code to your keybindings.json file in vs code.
Feel free to customize these shortcuts by changing key combinations.
,{
""key"": ""alt+l"",
""command"": ""cursorEnd"",
""when"": ""editorTextFocus""
},
{
""key"": ""alt+j"",
""command"": ""cursorHome"",
""when"": ""editorTextFocus""
}

I'm having an issue using Netbeans under Linux, I'm using Arch Linux with KDE and JRE 8 and, as you can see from the screenshot, the GUI fonts are ok, but the source code font rendering is very ugly. I'm using java options for AA, but it only solved the GUI issue, not the source code font rendering issue. I have PHPStorm installed too, to compare, I made a screenshot using the same font and settings in both. PHPStorm fonts are rendered beautifully, Netbeans doesn't, what's the problem?


"	"
As I could check, forcing PHPStorm to use the Oracle JDK, what makes font rendering different between Netbeans and PHPStorm is the JRE being used. When I forced PHPStorm to use the Oracle JDK it rendered fonts exactly the same way Netbeans renders. So JetBrains, with it's own JRE, were managed to make a JRE that renders fonts better than OpenJDK or OracleJDK.

I am curious why, in almost every JavaScript IDEs (like in WebStorm), unresolved variables or types (and any other errors) are just underlined with a light grey line as you can see in the picture.
As opposed to this, compiled language IDEs (like CLion) indicates errors with a clearly seen red line showing, that there is something important to recognize. I know notations can be modified, but I don't understand the logic behind the default notation.
I also don't know why JavaScript IDEs permit you to run the project, if there are errors. I suppose, because JS is an interpreted language?

"	"
Javascript variables are looked up at runtime. It's entirely possible that your HTML page includes some other 3rd party script, which sets a global variable, which your code then accesses at runtime. So even though it looks like the variable isn't defined because you didn't define it, it's entirely possible that the variable will exist at runtime and the IDE simply isn't able to trace that statically.

You can. But your question is quite vague. Maybe you could post your code? Learn about control flow (if-else, forEach, etc.) here.

Any idea ?
One more stuff :

Add: I try to install on a VM â€?and it's ok. So it's something on my PM but what?
"	"
It looks like it wasn't able to register (initialize) a package because the ...Modeling.dll is missing or isn't where it's expected to be.
In Windows 10 in a corporate environment, there could also be some permissions issues, especially if an uninstall / reinstall doesn't fix it.
I'd look at the folder structure and see what's there. Are the BPLs and DLLs where they're expected to be? Do you have full admin rights to the folders? Also, do all of the files have full accessibility to everybody or just the Admin user?
You need to run the installer with elevated permissions for Win 10, although the IT Dept can impose stricter limitations than inside of VMs. This can lead to files being installed but not accessible when you launch the program.
(The last place I was at, we had a separate Admin login from our normal login. We'd use it to install stuff. But component libs would sometimes go into ProgramFiles and sometimes into the User's Documents folder. Perms on those two folder trees were handled differently, and the components would be installed as only visible to the Admin and the IDE couldn't load them up. It was quite a PITA.)

You have to use the Android Studio Canary build to get an updated

Had to accept the licenses:
Automatically accept all SDK licences

sdkmanager --list [options]

I'm sure it's only a matter of time before the fix in canary is brought to stable, until then Good luck.

txtDisplay has not been initialized anywhere in the given code.
You might be referring to your textField object though?
JButton btn7 = new JButton(""7"");
btn7.addActionListener(new ActionListener() {


public void actionPerformed(ActionEvent e) {
//String EnterNumber = txtDisplay.getText() + btn7.getText();
//txtDisplay.setText(EnterNumber);
textField.setText(textField.getText() + btn7.getText());

}
});

I commented out the code where you use your txtDisplay object.
Keep in mind that every time you press the ""7"" Button, 7 will be written in the textField.

Is there a plugin or way to rearrange a single graphql schema file. Basically I want my graphql schema to be more organized. For example, All types should be at the top, followed by type Query followed by Mutations followed by Subscription and so on. Something similar to the code arrangement we do with class files in Intellij or other IDEs (i.e, constants at the top, followed by private variable, methods and so on)
"	"
Yes! There is the great package called format-graphql by Gajus Kuizinas that does exactly this -- enforcing consistent style on your schema. It is somewhat opinionated, so you can either 1) deal with the current custom options provided when you configure the package or 2) fork it, and rewrite this core utility to achieve the desired effect.

Closed last year.





Say I have this static method

And I need to use it on several different codes I'm writing.
Is there a way to save it in IntelliJ, so that next time I don't need to write it from the beginning but rather choose a shortcut?
Something similar to what it does with the setter and the getter methods, which are automatically written by the IDE itself.

To begin with, let's make a simple example, for example, the hello method. Go to Settings -> Editor - > Live Templates. Here you can view ready-made groups of templates and create your own by clicking on the plus sign on the right side of the panel. You can also create a separate template, then it will be added to the user group. After clicking, you will see a window at the bottom where you need to enter an abbreviation, descriptions, and the actual text of the template. There will also be a warning label ""No applicable context"" and a Define button next to it, clicking on which we will see a list of possible contexts â€?HTML, XML, Java, Javascript, CSS, and so on. Some have sub-items, for example in Java it is possible to use a template in a method, in a comment, at the class level, somewhere else, or everywhere at once. Choose the entire Java package as an example.
As an abbreviation, we will write hello, as a text, here is a line like this:
public static void hello() {
 System.out.println(""Hello"")
}

Click OK, after Apply and you can check. Create a class with any name, write hello inside, press TAB and voila â€?we have this method

In the legacy Apps Script Editor you could log e from Google Form submissions.
How is this done in the NEW Apps Script Editor?
function myFunction(e) {
Logger.log(e);
}

"	"
To make sure we are on the same page:
If you are going to run a function like this in any editor you are going to get null:

because simply e is not defined and it is only returning data upon trigger executions of this function. But this function is executed by some events depending on the type of trigger you are using. Therefore, you are not going to see anything (that is not null) in the console if you manually execute this function.
After the function is triggered by specific events:
In any editor again, you can go to the execution page to see the details of the execution. In the new editor, you go to Executions:

and you can see a list of all the executions of this particular function. For example, if your function is a simple onEdit trigger e.g. onEdit(e), you will see this upon editing a cell in the spreadsheet:

You can also see the type of the execution, whether it was executed by the script (Editor) or by a trigger (Simple Trigger).
But anyway, trigger functions are not supposed to be executed manually. As the name suggests, trigger functions are triggered upon events. It wouldn't make sense to use a trigger function and need to manually execute it. It would be a regular function then.

I don't know a way of doing that directly in atom default,but you can download the TabNine extension which does a great job for function and parameter hints in all languages that it supports including PHP.
Another alternative would be to use PHPStorm which also has a good parameter hint systems.

I want to implement 2 DrRacket plugins or tools, where I have a dependency between one tool and the other. Essentially, one tool must have access to a function provided by the other tool. The current code I have is something like:
providing tool:
(provide tool@ extra-signature^)
(define-signature extra-signature^ (some-procedure))
(define tool@ 
(unit
(import drracket:tool^)
(export drracket:tool-exports^ extra-signature^)
(define (phase1) void)
(define (phase2) void)
(define (some-procedure) void)
))

dependent tool:
(require extra-signature)
(provide tool@)
(define tool@
(unit
(import drracket:tool^ extra-signature^)
(export drracket:tool-exports^)
(define (phase1) void)
(define (phase2) void)
(some-procedure)
))

Trying to run DrRacket with above tools gives the error:
Error invoking tool #<path:/Users/...;(""dependentTool.rkt"")
define-unit-binding: unit argument expects an untagged import with signature extra-signature^, which this usage context does not supply
How can I actually implement such a dependency between DrRacket plugins?

As you can see in the image, the dart reformatted in intellij idea breaks the lines to prevent having lines too wide. However, my monitor has a lot of space and thus the reformatter doesn't need to break lines too soon.

Just finished full installation of Nim language to my Debian GNU/linux and feel a bit confused, not finding any development kits or at least console commands to try some scripting... Isn't it supposed to be included into instalation packages?
So I'll be thankfull to any advice how to choose between all aviable IDE or interfaces for coding with Nim on Linux.
"	"
Nim's main entry point is the nim command. As long as you have that, you can compile and run nim programs all right:
$ cat > test.nim
echo ""Hello nim!""
$ nim c -r test.nim
CC: stdlib_io.nim
CC: stdlib_system.nim
CC: test.nim
Hint:[Link]
Hint: 14205 LOC; 1.218 sec; 20.496MiB peakmem; Debug build; proj: /private/tmp/t/test.nim; out: /private/tmp/t/test [SuccessX]
Hint: /private/tmp/t/test[Exec]
Hello nim!
$ 

You can also embed that as a shebang into an executable hi.nim file and run it:
#!/usr/bin/env nim c --hints:off -r

echo ""Hi nim scripting!""

But you will get a compiled binary without the .nim extension along the original file, so it's kind of awkward for scripting.
UPDATE: As suggested by @shirleyquirk you can also save .nims files with a special shebang that will run them as NimScript, which has some limitations compared to normal Nim code but should be fine for most if not all typical scripts.
............................................................
Nim isn't included in any development kits as far as I'm concerned. There are a lot of editors with Nim addons though. That includes most popular editors like VSCode, emacs or vim.
If you wanted to you could just use a terminal as an interface with a simple editor.

Qt Creator is not parsing the include files in my project properly and gives a lot of errors in the IDE, including errors like main.cpp:14:5: error: unknown type name 'QApplication'. However, my project compiles perfectly fine. I am getting tired of all these supposed errors and am wondering if there is any way to fix this issue.
My .pro file looks like this:
QT += core gui widgets
# The following define makes your compiler emit warnings if you use
# any Qt feature that has been marked deprecated (the exact warnings
# depend on your compiler). Please consult the documentation of the
# deprecated API in order to know how to port your code away from it.

# You can also make your code fail to compile if it uses deprecated APIs.
# In order to do so, uncomment the following line.
# You can also select to disable deprecated APIs only up to a certain version of Qt.
#DEFINES += QT_DISABLE_DEPRECATED_BEFORE=0x060000# disables all the APIs deprecated before Qt 6.0.0

I had a hunch from a few days ago (I forget exactly how I got this hunch) that stddef.h was causing the problem. So I added #include <stddef.h> to my main.cpp, and Qt Creator gave the error:
/home/loren/code/klock/main.cpp:12: error: 'stddef.h' file not found
/usr/include/c++/9/ostream:42: to match this '{'

where the '{' is the beginning { in namespace std.

Somebody on the Qt forums told me to go to the Help Menu > About Plugins > Disable the ClangCodeModel plugin. This required a restart of Qt Creator, but it fixed my problem.

The structure should be valid even for html 4.01 . however i get the invalid location tag warning on eclipse for the nested/inner list.
Any idea why? And how to fix it without making eclipse just ignore that element
Thanks
"	"
According to W3.org markup check <ol> does not allow to be within the <ul> element directly.
So you have to wrap your <ol> element inside a <li>, so do this like this:


<ul>
<li>level one item one</li>
<li>
<ol>
<li>level two item one</li>
<li>level two item two</li>
</ol>
</li>
<li>level one item two</li>
</ul>




If in any case, you wanted to hide the list style element from <ol> part you can do it by CSS styles like this:


ul > li:nth-child(2) {
list-style: none;
}
<ul>
<li>level one item one</li>
<li>
<ol>
<li>level two item one</li>
<li>level two item two</li>
</ol>
</li>
<li>level one item two</li>

Quick Question for Visual Studio 2019 Version 16.8.3, How do you connect the work item to the commit in the new git changes tab? I am having a really hard time using this new git experience thing. I can see my work item in team explorer but no idea how to add this work item to the commit in this new interface. Usually, there will be a button to add related work items when committing the files in the previous version. Please someone help me out?
"	"

it look like you can just use hashtag '#' in commit message,

That is the recommended syntax.
Example:
Fix a bug #1234

That would actually close the work item
See more at ""Drive Git development from a work item""
You can link a work item to commits but also other objects:

The link types you can add within the development section are Branch, Build, Changeset, Commit, Found in build, Integrated in build, Pull Request, and Versioned Item.


............................................................
You could also turn of the preview of the new Git features.
TOOLS=> OPTIONS => search for preview => checkbox

If you like the preview feel free to keep using it of course.
Personally I'm not really digging it.

Everytime i try to copy and paste something on my Pycharm editor it all paste it in single line. How to automatically paste in multiline?[1]

and this all got pasted in a single line on my Pycharm editor. can anybody help with that, its pretty hard to read all this info on a single line?
"	"
It seems like you didn't copy anything containing newlines as you can see better after my edit (See the side-by-side-markdown diff so you can see that I didn't remove any line breaks).

If you just copy everything as a single line, PyCharm won't be able to split it into multiple lines (except with auto-format maybe).

As you haven't said how you copied the input, I can't say what exactly is wrong.

However, it seems like you copied something from a program that didn't display the text correctly so that you couldn't copy it correctly.

Another possibility is that the IDE interprets line breaks differently.

For example, windows uses CRLF(carriage return+line feed) as a line seperator while linux uses LF only.

If your file contains only LF line breaks and PyCharm is configured to use CRLF like breaks, it is possible that it ignores them because of that.

You can change that behaviour at the bottom of your file in PyCharm (button with CR/CRLF/LF).

After making simple methods such as:

public int getHeight() {

public Game getGame() {

It will be reformatted as:

public int getHeight() { return game.getHeight();}

I have the box for ""simple methods in one line"" unchecked and it still happens. How can I fix this?
"	"
Just saying, it's not that bad since you can click on the method and it expands it.

But you can click File | Settings | Editor | General | Code Folding and click Collapse by Default. Then uncheck One-Line Methods under the Java section.
"																															
0	"

In Android Studio 3.6.1. (Java 8) there are multiple options for folding (Code -> Folding):


Collapse - Collapses the code block the cursor is in, if I put it at the start of a method, it only collapses that but not the if, for, whatever else inside.
Collapse Recursively - Collapses the code block the cursor is in but also all the if, for, //... inside.
Collapse All - Works like Collapse Recursively but collapses all the functions in the file, so it's actually a ""Collapse All Rescursively"".


Using the third option in a file with a lot of methods/code blocks, if I just want to work on a single method, means that I have to unfold everything inside that code block again.

I know that Eclipse and Visual Studio are able to fold all methods non-recursively (my shortcuts there are: Ctrl + Shift + Numpad / for folding and Ctrl + Shift + Numpad * for unfolding) but how do I do the same thing in Android Studio?

Unfortunately it appears this can't be done. The best way to deal with this that I've found is to expand the desired method recursively with ctrl alt +

I've clicked a ""Help"" button in an error message box shown by the C++Builder IDE, and another error message box pops up telling me

RAD Studio's help is not installed. Please reinstall RAD Studio's documentation.

So I seem to have missed checking the checkbox for installing the help when installing C++Builder 11.2. I would like to fix that and install the documentation.
When I invoke the C++Builder installer again, the installer says

A previous version of RAD Studio 11 was found on your system that needs to be uninstalled first.

But the message is not quite correct, it is not a previous version that is installed, but the exact same version: 11.2 is currently installed, and the installer that I execute is for 11.2, and exactly the same installer that I have previously used to install the current version. I've double-checked.
Is uninstalling and reinstalling the only way to get the documentation for the 11.2 version, or is there some way how I can just add the documentation to the existing installation?

Edited:
As Remy Lebeau has pointed out in a comment to this answer, you can open a ""feature manager"" inside RADStudio by choosing menu item Tools->""Manage Platforms..."" which will show you all options from the installer again, and allow to change the options and apply the changes.
I wish I had known this before I actually uninstalled and reinstalled C++Builder with some hassles (described in the original answer).

Using Xcode 12, my build contains many targets. After the build ends, the Report Navigator displays the issues for each target in an expanded mode. To collapse, I have to close the target nodes one by one which is a great nuisance. Even after closing all, the moment you navigate around and go back to that page - the target reports are expanded again.
Tried:

cmd + click (alt + click, cmd + shift + click) on one of the target nodes.
Right click on one of the nodes, select ""Collapse all transcripts"".

None help. Any advice?
EDIT: clarification: the question is about multiple targets, i.e.:
Build Target t1
error 1
error 2
Build Target t2
error 3
error 4

> Build Target t2

You are using pylance which requires an extraPaths setting for intellisense to work properly in subdirectories (they really need to fix this).
Create a directory .vscode in the root of your project, then create a settings.json file in that folder. Edit the content of settings.json as follows:

{
""python.analysis.extraPaths"": [""ws_functions""] // the name of your project folder dirctory
}

now you should be able to:
from . import config # or another file

Code runs on IDE but not on Linux machine

On Linux, you could edit your C code with GNU emacs or vim or gedit etc..., then compile your code with the GCC compiler invoked as gcc -Wall -Wextra -g (perhaps in a terminal) to get all warnings and debug info.
Read of course Modern C and see this reference. See also Advanced Linux Programming and man pages like syscalls(2), fopen(3), errno(3) etc....
You probably want to use perror(3) when fopen fails.
Improve your C code to get no warnings at all from gcc
Then, use the GDB debugger to understand the behavior of your program. You could run your program step by step, ask values of variables, etc... from the debugger.
Consider also using the Clang static analyzer.
Be aware that in 2021 UTF-8 is used everywhere. Maybe you want to accept some input like Gabrielles d'EstrÃ©es in your doctorlist.txt file?

VSCode on my Macbook Pro is practically unusable due to the intellisense being ungodly slow. This includes:

hovering to find typescript types, inferred and explicit types
autocomplete variables/functions/etc
autocomplete for using shortcuts
error lines shown in editor

For example, I will have an error show. Something like ""variable not defined"" or something simple. But then when I go to rewrite the code, it takes forever for VSCode to catch up. Sometimes I have to let it sit 40-50seconds before it catches up with my changes.
Hovering over typescript types is practically impossible at times and utterly useless. Below is a screenshot of the ""lag"" - changes were made, but it stuck like this for 30+ seconds:


It may be the specific project, because I can't recreate it for smaller projects. However, its only a 200k line project.
No specific extensions are slowing down VScode
I tried downgrading VsCode with no help

VSCODE VERSION: 1.47.3

In my case, the issue was GitLens. I was able to isolate this issue by using the Command Palette (Control + Shift + P) to disable all extensions (this will not uninstall them), restarted Visual Studio, then checked if the issue persists.
The issue did indeed persist, so I went into the Extensions taband filtered by @disabled:

By reenabling my extensions one by one, I found GitLens to be the culprit.

I am wondering if GoLand can use the dlv exec command for debugging.
The reason we need this is because we have a complicated build process with CGO, and it's impossible to create a run configuration that works.
Maybe attach to process could work, but it doesn't seem like a great solution.
VSCode has nice integration with dlv exec, but the IDE works too slow and buggy, I wish we could use GoLand.
Has anybody found a solution for this?
Thanks in advance.
"	"
You can use the same steps as in debugging a remote process.
Those steps are:

build the binary with go build -gcflags=""all=-N -l"" -o myApp and any other flags you might need for CGO/etc.
run the binary using dlv --listen=:2345 --headless=true --api-version=2 exec ./myApp
go to Run | Edit Configurations | + | Go Remoteand create a new run configuration that connects to localhost on port 2345 (or any other port you specify in delve's --listen flag.

I'm new to Python and just beginning to learn. I notice when I'm typing in either the IDE or the text editor, a box sometimes pops up that appears to allow for autofill / autocomplete. I'm not sure if that is what it is. If so, I would like to take advantage of it but I haven't figured out how to do so. I haven't found any explanations online although I may not be describing it enter image description here correctly. I have included a jpeg to show what I'm seeing.
Thanks.

In the picture it looks like it's telling you what argument you have to put inside.

The call stack at least gives enough hints on what to look for next.
Line 383:HttpClientCertificate httpCert = HttpContext.Current.Request.ClientCertificate;
Line 384:X509Certificate2 x509Cert = new X509Certificate2(httpCert.Certificate);
Line 385:_subject = x509Cert.Subject;

This piece of code tries to grab the client certificate sent by the browser, and then access its Subject property. This access attempt failed and an exception happened,
[CryptographicException: m_safeCertContext is an invalid handle.]
 System.Security.Cryptography.X509Certificates.X509Certificate.ThrowIfContextInvalid() +12505161
 System.Security.Cryptography.X509Certificates.X509Certificate.get_Subject() +14

Since .NET Framework in general wraps up native Windows API, so the exception itself can be quite confusing.
""The code runs great in production on the web server"", so that I can assume your server administrators have configured this production machine to know how to build full chains for client certificates (very common server configuration), but you might not have done the same on your development machine. Talk to the server administrators and learn what you missed.
In the meantime, you might set a break at line 384 and analyze more details of httpCert. That might help you find out what settings are missing.

I want to load classes from a module (.jmod) file at runtime into the application memory.
I know that we can easily load classes from a (.jar) file using :-)
ClassLoader loader = URLClassLoader.newInstance(new URL[]{
jarFile.toURL()
});

The total code snippet can be found at this-repo in src omega.deassembler.JarLoader class
But the problem is URLClassLoader is unable to read the modules(.jmod).
So is there any other internal class or library to load classes from a module(.jmod) file.
Actually, I am creating an IDE and this-repo is a part of it for loading content-assist hints.
Earlier, I was using javap command to disassemble and load hints (see omegaide on github).
But this technique consumes much time, so i am writing it again!
Thank You.
"	"
This is not exactly the answer but a method to make URLClassLoader usable when it has to read modules.
Earlier URLClassLoader was throwing this exception when trying to read a module file(.jmod)
when omitting the module-info
Exception in thread ""main"" java.lang.NoClassDefFoundError: com/sun/javafx/event/DirectEvent (wrong name: classes/com/sun/javafx/event/DirectEvent)
at java.base/java.lang.ClassLoader.defineClass1(Native Method)
at java.base/java.lang.ClassLoader.defineClass(ClassLoader.java:1010)
etc

and when including the meta-info
Exception in thread ""main"" java.lang.NoClassDefFoundError: classes/module-info is not a class because access_flag ACC_MODULE is set


This means that it is unable to identify the directory system inside the jmod file.
So as we know, that a simple jar file contains classes and resources only (Just exclude meta-info).
And in a module file(.jmod), all the classes are placed inside the classes folder and all the resources are placed in the resources folder.
Thus, We can create a temporary jar file say ""modular-jar.jar"" with the contents of classes and resources from the module file,
and then using standard URLClassLoader we can load it onto the classpath
and then can immediately delete the file.
This will just work at least in my case
Here's the code snippet
public static synchronized JarLoader prepareModule(String modulePath){
try{
ZipFile moduleFile = new ZipFile(modulePath);
ZipOutputStream zipOutputStream = new ZipOutputStream(new FileOutputStream(""readable-module-data.jar""));
for(Enumeration enums = moduleFile.entries(); enums.hasMoreElements();){
ZipEntry entry = (ZipEntry)enums.nextElement();
String name = entry.getName();
if((name.startsWith(""classes"") && !name.contains(""module-info"")) || name.startsWith(""resources"")){
 zipOutputStream.putNextEntry(new ZipEntry(name.substring(name.indexOf('/') + 1)));
 InputStream in = moduleFile.getInputStream(entry);
 while(in.available() > 0)
zipOutputStream.write(in.read());
 zipOutputStream.flush();
}
}
zipOutputStream.close();
}
catch(Exception e){
e.printStackTrace();
}
return new JarLoader(""readable-module-data.jar"");
}

I'm a beginner in Machine Learning.
I've been learning about YOLO and DarkFlow from the following links with Ubuntu 20.04: darkflow and Tiny YOLO.
I successfully executed the code, and got the results like this:

Statistics:
car: 436
person: 73
Dataset size: 2599
Dataset of 2599 instance(s)
Training statistics:
Learning rate : 1e-05
Batch size: 16
Epoch number: 1000
Backup every: 2000

It's not bad, but the training's taking way too much time.
But I wanna know if there is any powerful IDE or other tools that can help me reduce time. 
I searched in google and tried to find many ways to improve. 
I heard that there are many ways to make training faster,(including Azure AI ML service) but since I'm a beginner, I cannot decide which will be the perfect choice to run YOLO and DarkFlow.
I would appreciate advices about robust development environments, especially the ones that would be suitable in my current specific condition. 
Thanks in advance!
++) Since I'm a mere sophomore, the level of the hardware that I can use is very limited. I would also appreciate tools that can help me overcome the limitations of my hardware!
"	"
The IDE usually won't decrease computing time, but is rather based around the compiler. Likely, you'll just have to deal with intensive training times if you can't get better hardware. However, you might look into using a gpu to do computations(if you have one) rather than the standard way it runs on the cpu. Here's a link as to how to achieve this in Tensorflow: https://stackoverflow.com/a/51307381/14392018 . The general rule is the more data and the more complex the ML/DL model(i.e. the more layers in a neural network), the longer it takes to compute 1 epoch on the dataset. Also, the more data you're working with, the higher the computational intensity.

I am trying to typehint a bunch of javascript in Google Script, and I have gotten as far as trying this:
/**
 *Get (named) range given by name
 *
 *@param {String} name 
 *@return {Range}
 *
 */
function getRange(name) {
return SpreadsheetApp.getActiveSpreadsheet().getRangeByName(name);
}

Which displays well and gives the same typehint as the builtin getRangeByName, however it does not actually work, i.e. the auto-complete script editor does not autocomplete when I type something like getRange(""hello"").get"", like it should. Should I be name spacing the Range or am I doing something else wrong?
"	"
The current Google Apps Script IDE doesn't use local JSDOC to extend the autocomplete feature. Options:

Create a Goole Apps Script library and attach it to your project
Use another IDE

Regarding using another IDE at this time there is a tool called CLASP that helps to download/upload script which make it possible to use other IDEs.

I'm experimenting with NetBeans and really like how some things are done. I'm coming from Eclipse. Features like the ability to sort the source code items aren't working.
Using:
Product Version: Apache NetBeans IDE 12.1
Java: 1.8.0_131; Java HotSpot(TM) 64-Bit Server VM 25.131-b11

User directory: /home/bpracht/.netbeans/12.1
Cache directory: /home/bpracht/.cache/netbeans/12.1

In the sample class, I'd like to sort this in a conventional way (ie. private fields sorted at the top, public methods at the bottom. After clicking Format ""Alt-Shift-F"" on the class below, it does not alter the order any further:
class Token<T> {

public Token offsetStart(final Long value) {
this.offsetStart = value;
return this;
}

public Token length(final Long value) {

You can order the members by using the Source menu then choosing Organize Members:

The result of organizing members using my settings:
class Token<T> {

private Token nextToken;

private LambdaSetValue<T> lambdaSetValue;

public Token offsetStart(final Long value) {

public Token length(final Long value) {
this.length = value;

}

public Token fullyResolved(final Boolean value) {
this.fullyResolved = value;

}

public Token parentToken(final Token value) {
this.parentToken = value;
return this;
}

public Token firstChildToken(final Token value) {
this.firstChildToken = value;
return this;
}

public Token lastChildToken(final Token value) {
this.lastChildToken = value;
return this;
}

public Token previousToken(final Token value) {
this.previousToken = value;
return this;
}

public Token nextToken(final Token value) {
this.nextToken = value;
return this;
}

public Token lambdaSetValue(final LambdaSetValue<T> value) {
this.lambdaSetValue = value;
return this;
}

public Long getLength() {
return length;
}

public long getOffsetStart() {
return offsetStart;
}

public void setOffsetStart(long offsetStart) {
this.offsetStart = offsetStart;
}

public void setLength(Long length) {
this.length = length;
}
}

interface LambdaSetValue<T> {
void setValue(T value);
}

As mentioned in my comment, both private Long offsetStart and private Long length have the same access levels and the same type with no functional code difference, and Netbeans does not apply alphabetical order (in English).

I've been using LUA to create wireshark dissectors by editing the LUA file, filled with PRINT statements, and running Wireshark with the console open to trace the dissector. The edit/test cycle is cumbersome and I do a lot of iteration for simple syntax errors and other things a smart IDE would catch before the test cycle is run.
Is Zerobrane a good option for this? I use LUA exclusively in this context. Can it live debug a Wireshark run?
"	"
I did post an example of how ZeroBrane Studio can be used to debug Wireshark script, but it was done long time ago, so not sure if anything has changed in Wireshark Lua support that would prevent this from working. At that time when the script was posted it did allow debugging of a Wireshark run, but there are timeout aspects that may need to be taken into account: since the debugger blocks Lua execution while you step or evaluate values, the results may be affected by Wireshark timeout logic.
In terms of catching syntax errors earlier, you can definitely use static analysis in the IDE to catch syntax errors, variable typos, and some other errors.

I know we can create Live Templates in the settings, and group them, but we would like to have a set of Live Templates on a per project basis.

In VS Code, you can create code-snippets files in the .vscode folder, and those snippets follow the project, so anyone who clones that project will get those project-specific snippets.

Is the any way to put Live Template xml files in the .idea folder and have WebStorm pick them up..?

Please note: I'm not asking about Visual Studio Code, I'm asking about VS 2017. I know how to change these setting in VSCode. After googling multiple times for VS2017, I finally gave up. Maybe I didn't phrase the question correctly.

Example shown below. 



After I click on the ""Keep Open"" option, the file gets added to the open set of tabs. 
I would prefer to have this behavior by default. 

Also, it it possible to add this tab to the right of all other open tabs? Currently, it adds itself to the beginning. I prefer to append new tabs to the right/rear.


"	"
You can uncheck the Allow new files to be opened in the preview tab option to keep files open:



And there is the Insert new tabs to the right of existing tabs option nearby to add this tab to the right of all other open tabs.

In Sublime Text 2, I'm running a Python script (for loop) continuously print out some results in the output panel.

I accidentally pressed the search shortcut (Ctrl + f) and the search panel appeared. The output panel disappeared. 

Is there a way to call back (great to have the printed out contents) the output panel? 

Thank you.

In Sublime 2, in order to call up the build results window you can use the Tools > Build Results > Show Build Results menu item.

If you're using Sublime 3, the same menu item exists but is also bound to a key as well (check the menu item to see what it is for your platform), and you can click on the panel chooser icon in the bottom left of the window to open a menu that displays all panels and choose the output panel from there.

If you're using one of the beta builds for Sublime 4, the same options exist as for Sublime 3 but you have to right click on the panel chooser icon to open the panel menu, as a left click instead toggles the state of the side bar.

Regardless of the version of Sublime that you're using, the build results can only be displayed in a window where at least one build has been performed (each window has its own panel). For Sublime 3 and 4 that means that the panel won't appear in the panel chooser for windows that haven't completed a build yet.
............................................................
I use the keyboard shortcut CTRL+ALT+R for this, to avoid to have to open the menu Tools > Build Results > Show Build results each time.
For this, just add the following line in your Default (Windows).sublime-keymap file:
{ ""keys"": [""ctrl+alt+r""], ""command"": ""show_panel"",""args"": { ""panel"": ""output.exec"" } },

I want to jump through files in the project window using the up / down buttons. Now I press the down button, then press the enter button and the focus goes to the code editor window. But I do not want the focus to go away, I want to continue jumping through the files, pressing the down button and enter when I want to open the file. I can do this using this combination: down arrow, enter, F12, down arrow, down arrow, enter, F12 ...
Is there any way to tweak this to avoid using F12?
I'm using Intellij idea 2020.3

I'd suggest reassigning shortcut combination Main Menu | Window | Active Tool Window | Jump to Last Tool Window to anything more suitable for you, e.g. ESC and be sure that you don't use the same shortcut for other actions and operations.

From today morning, my Visual Studio is behaving very strangely. I get the error ""one or more errors occurred failed to launch debug adapter"" whenever I run the project.

I run my project profile instead of running it in the IIS Express profile. Here is my launchSettings.json file.
{
""iisSettings"": {
""windowsAuthentication"": false,
""anonymousAuthentication"": true,
""iisExpress"": {
""applicationUrl"": ""http://localhost:65498"",
""sslPort"": 44318
}
},
""profiles"": {
""IIS Express"": {
""commandName"": ""IISExpress"",
""launchBrowser"": true,
""environmentVariables"": {
""ASPNETCORE_ENVIRONMENT"": ""Development""
}
},
""<ProjectName>"": {
""commandName"": ""Project"",
""launchBrowser"": true,
""environmentVariables"": {
""ASPNETCORE_ENVIRONMENT"": ""Development""
},
""applicationUrl"": ""https://localhost:5001;http://localhost:5000""
}
}
}

And when I check the Output window, this is what I get.

The program '[22052] .exe' has exited with code -1
(0xffffffff).

Another thing I noticed is that a new browser tab is opened without any URL in it, just an about:blank page.
"	"
I am having this problem too and think it may have something to do with the Edge Browser(or an update?) and the JavaScript Debugger. The first time I run a WebApp, everything works fine.Every time afterwards, I receive the ""failed to launch debug adapter"" shown above.
I have to either disable the Javascript Debugger or Use Internet Explorer to run the app.

............................................................
The issue was that the process that got started from my previous execution was still running. When we start the project using the profile project, it will start a new process, and you can see that there is a new Debug console window as in the preceding image.

You can just close this window and run your project again, and that will fix the issues. You can also enable a setting that will close this process when the debugging stops. To do that, go to Tools and then click on Options, select Debugging and then enable the option Automatically close the console when debugging stops.

If you don't see the option, just click on the other options under the Debugging menu, and wait for the contents to load, and then click on the Debugging menu again. Sometimes it was just showing a blank screen without any options. Seems like a bug in Visual Studio 2019.
Also, make sure to close the browser window that was opened from the last execution. For me it was opened, that is the reason why a new tab with about: blank was opening.
Happy Coding!.
............................................................
We're having the same problem as zBestData above since moving to Visual Studio 2019, Version 16.9.1.
We don't have much time to look into it at the moment but seems to be related to msedge.exe processes left running after a debug session. As a workaround, before starting a second debug session, close all open Edge windows, then kill any msedge.exe instances (eg in Task Manager).
Otherwise, we find we need to Restart the system to clear the fault.
............................................................
The issue is most likely with your browser, which acts as debug adapter in this case. Close all instances of your browser.
Explanation:
As the error message indicates, there is additional information in the output window.
Open the visualstudio-js-debugger.txt file. It should be in a location similar to the one below.
Remember to replace your-user-name in the path below with your correct username.
C:/Users/*your-user-name*/AppData/Local/Temp/visualstudio-js-debugger.txt

The file should look as below, take note of the adapter Id, highlighted in red, it is the Chrome Browser. So you can just close all instances of the Chrome Browser in this case.

You can use the wrong way to write the int data type function.
use: print(displaySum(num1,num2));
............................................................
The System.out.println() method does not support formatting. Try the following:
public static void displaySum(int x , int y) 
{
System.out.printf(""Sum of %d and %d is %d "",x,y,x+y); 
} 

or also:
public static void displaySum(int x , int y) 
{
System.out.format(""Sum of %d and %d is %d "",x,y,x+y); 
}

Barmar's comment, that image[x + a][y + b] will access outside the array when x = 0 and a = -1, told me specifically where the error was. I was able to find my problem, which is that one of my if-statements was missing a continue, so the code that wasn't meant to execute for a specific case would end up being run anyway. The correct code should have been
if ((x + a < 0) || (x + a > height - 1))
{
for (int z = 0; z < 3; z++)
{
gx_red[a + 1][z] *= 0;
gy_red[a + 1][z] *= 0;
gx_blue[a + 1][z] *= 0;
gy_blue[a + 1][z] *= 0;
gx_green[a + 1][z] *= 0;
gy_green[a + 1][z] *= 0;
}
continue;
}

instead of
if ((x + a < 0) || (x + a > height - 1))
{
for (int z = 0; z < 3; z++)
{
gx_red[a + 1][z] *= 0;
gy_red[a + 1][z] *= 0;
gx_blue[a + 1][z] *= 0;
gy_blue[a + 1][z] *= 0;
gx_green[a + 1][z] *= 0;
gy_green[a + 1][z] *= 0;

I am using Visual studio 2019 for learning C++. Every time I am crating project for each program. Is it possible to crate and run multiple main source file on Visual Studio like Java on Eclipse/Netbeans/IntellijIdea? Thank you.
"	"
The short answer ""You can't and you can"".

main() is called an entry point. In Java you can have main() in every class because each class can be self-contained in theory.

C++ doesn't work like this because at the end every thing get linked to a single executable.

If you want to have multiple entry points You need to:


Create seperate *.cpp file for every entry point, each file should define its own main() function.
Each file should have a separate binary target in your build system(Cmake...etc)
Build & Run target as needed.

............................................................
There is two ways of doing it. Either you use cmake, more info here

or

you put the main functions in separate namespaces and then define, which one do you want to run. example here

I am currently using WebStorm 2019.3.4 and in an Angular project, I cannot break long lines when try to reformat code pressing CTRL + ALT + L.

I have the default configuration for the IDE and TypeScript.

Example of long line I want to break:

export const countyList = [{
 countyName: 'Alachua',
 taxRate: '0.01',
 zipCodeList: ['32601', '32602', '32603', '32604', '32605', '32606', '32607', '32608', '32609', '32610', '32611', '32612', '32613', '32614', '32615', '32616', '32618', '32627', '32631', '32635', '32641', '32643', '32653', '32654', '32655', '32658', '32662', '32667', '32669', '32694']
}];

A default formatting behavior for arrays is not to wrap them. You can configure it yourself using this set of options:

I have the following simple code in C language:

#include <stdio.h>

int main(){
printf(""Give an integer:\n"");
int x;
scanf(""%d"",&x);
printf(""10*%d=%d\n"",x,10*x);

return 0;
}


Using CodeBlocks IDE it is executed in the right order but when I use Eclipse IDE it jumps 
to the scanf command and then prints the messages as it should. Can anyone explain this? 

Thank you in advance

Usually stdout is set to line buffered. Apparently one of your IDEs sets it to fully buffered.

You can force prints to dump the associated buffer with fflush(), eg

printf(""hello ""); // works in unbuffered stream
printf(""world!\n""); // works in line buffered stream
fflush(stdout); // works in fully buffered stream

Question:
Is there a way to install a downloaded NBM (Netbeans Module) into an already installed Netbeans IDE via CLI?
Current setup
Netbeans 12.3 with Windows 10
Netbeans 12.3 with Linux Mint 20.1
Relevant scenario
If the question comes to your mind 'why aren't you just using the GUI?' or anything like that. Think of the following scenario. When working on an air gapped network with 50 computers you're the one having to install Netbeans plugins on all of that PCs. You're able to put files on those PCs and execute a command via console and you don't want to run around all the buildings and clicking through the process.
Thank you very much in advance.
"	"
I think I found a solution. I'll post it here to reflect my research because I've never found a answer on stackoverflow.
When Netbeans is already installed you can use the --help parameter like:
C:\Program Files\NetBeans\netbeans\bin\netbeans64.exe --help
This listslot of available parameters (which I haven't found a list of on the web) like (shortened):
General options:
--helpshow this help
--jdkhome <path>path to JDK
--console new open new console for output

Module reload options:
--reload /path/to/module.jarinstall or reinstall a module JAR file

Additional module options:
--modules
--refresh Refresh all catalogs
--listPrints the list of all modules, their versions and enablement status
--install <arg1>...<argN> Installs provided JAR files as modules
--disable <arg1>...<argN> Disable modules for specified codebase names
--enable <arg1>...<argN>Enable modules for specified codebase names
--update <arg1>...<argN>Updates all or specified modules
--update-allUpdates all modules

Core options:
--fontsize <size> set the base font size of the user interface, in points
--userdir <path>use specified directory to store user settings
--nosplashdo not show the splash screen

In my case the solution was to use the --install parameter pointing to the jar file to install.Be aware that the NBM files are just containers containing the jar file and some more meta data files like config xml files. You're able to open it via 7zip for example. And you'll have to take care of all the dependencies yourself.

According to the documentation of vscode for c++, theintelliSenseMode has two different modes:

gcc-x64

clang-x64


I just wonder:
What are the differences between the two modes?
"	"
This option tells intelliSense which compiler to use. So either gcc or clang.
From the official docs of VS Code (here):

intelliSenseMode: The IntelliSense mode to use that maps to an architecture-specific variant of MSVC, gcc, or Clang. If not set or if set to ${default}, the extension will choose the default for that platform.
Platform defaults:

Windows: msvc-x64
Linux: gcc-x64
macOS: clang-x64


For a comparison between the two compilers, see e.g. here.

For context: I am creating a website in html+ejs+mongoose which I had created locally on my pc. Since I want to see the website running on another device besides my local computer, I uploaded the files on GitHub and then cloned it into an online IDE, in this case, GoormIDE, to do that.

Because of this, I can't start the website because it needs mongoDB/mongoose in order to run the server.
It seems that mongod/mongoDB doesn't have a data directory. Any ideas?
"	"
I already found the answer guys!
I just need to put -dbpath ./data/db after mongod
With that, I created a directory of data/db where I will store all the data from mongoDB.
so now I edited the file that I created named ""mongod"" with: mongod --nojournal -dbpath ./data/db and everything works once again. I feel pretty silly not knowing this but I hope I will never make this mistake again.

You suppose we used some class in current class and now wen I want to open class reference by holding ctrl and pressing left click I expect class reference should be opened in new tab but that show in bottom of class like with below screen shot. However that's not bad but I want to show that in new tab

Please check whether â€œPreview Modeâ€?is in effect.
For VScode, to stop files from going into preview mode, and always open a new tab go to File -> Preferences -> Settings (or Ctrl + ,)
And try adding the following to â€œUsers Settingsâ€?""workbench.editor.enablePreview"": false
Please include a comma if thereâ€™s other settings as it has to be a valid json

When using vim (or any other text editor) for python scripts, is there a way to run a section of your script alone?
Matlab has a feature where beginning a line with %% splits the lines of code that follow into a section of its own, that can be run independently. Is there a way of achieving this without having to use iPython? Even if the solution is a bit hacky, it would be an improvement over what I currently am doing, which is commenting out blocks that I don't want to run.
"	"
A generic solution would be vim-slime: https://github.com/jpalardy/vim-slime

SLIME is an Emacs plugin to turn Emacs into a Lisp IDE. You can type
text in a file, send it to a live REPL, and avoid having to reload all
your code every time you make a change.
Vim-slime is a humble attempt at getting some of these features into
Vim. It works with any REPL and isn't tied to Lisp.

I am working on a c# code for the last couple of weeks and I debug it very often.
VS 2019 was working properly but suddenly it got very slow and laggy when I tried to debug my code.
I checked all resources on my machine. All seem as before and are available enough.
Even I checked the same IDE with other codes. All runs and debugs fast enough as before.
I also updated my IDE to the last version (currently 16.8.5 by the end of February 2021).
Did anybody has the same experience with the VS2019 ever?
Thanks in advance.
"	"
Not sure whether the issue is caused your code with IDE environment together. Please try the following suggestions:
1) disable any third party installed extensions under Extensions-->Manage Extensions-->Installed to check whether an extension caused that.
2) reset settings under Tools-->Import and Export Settings-->Reset all settings and you can also make a backup of the settings
3) close VS, delete all files under C:\Users\xxx\AppData\Local\Microsoft\VisualStudio\16.0_xxx\ComponentModelCache
and also delete .vs hidden folder under your solution folder, bin and obj folder.
4) type devenv /safemode under Developer Command Prompt for VS to start a pure VS and then try your project.
5) create a new project with your same code and check if this works.
Besides, if all do not help, you could try a small reproducible sample with us.
............................................................
If debugging suddenly becomes slow, you might consider checking your symbol settings and debugging settings. If you for example enable .NET framework source stepping, debugging can be slow, or if you do not cache symbols or disable for example Just My Code or enable other stuff, like IntelliTrace or install a bad extension.
It might not be an alternative for you, but I am pleased to inform you that I have been using Visual Studio 2022 and it is radically faster. Yes, this is not opinionated, this is an observation. It IS faster. Maybe it is because I do not have many extensions on it, but it is also a 64-bit application with less memory pressure on the GC. So you can first check your settings and then give VS 2022 Preview versions for a spin. I have used it for months and the amount of bugs are rather small if you do typically development. For a Preview version, I am impressed with what they are working for nextgen Visual Studio.
You should also clean your solution and delete and bin and obj folders via for example Powershell script to make sure your binaries are updated. Then rebuild.

If you have ""live share"" extension enabled, perhaps can try to disable / uninstall that. This one was causing my problem.

Ok, @Mr Qian no 3 did the trick for me.
Situation: After a ""Cleanup"" (Microsoft Visual Studio\Installer\InstallCleanup.exe) my VS2019 was partially gone. Good tool. :-(
After (re)install, I had 2 folders ""ComponentModelCache"" over 2 folders of 16.0_xxx : 16.0_4f678462 and 16.0_119826cb
I renamed both ""ComponentModelCache"" folders (you can delete later, when it has effect)
Build ran as never before...
Thank you, Mr Qian

I often use VS 2019 (16.8.5) to profile applications developed with Qt on Windows (10). I've got it configured as an external tool in Qt Creator.
However, every time I open it by just running devenv.exe, I have to go through the same process of clicking ""Continue with No Code"" on the startup welcome screen, then selecting Debug â†?Performance Profiler from the menu. I'd like to automate that as much as possible.
So my question is: Is there any way, from the command line, to start the IDE, skip that welcome screen, and go straight to the profiler? If not, can I at least skip the welcome screen?
I looked in the manual but couldn't find anything that seemed to do the job (/NoSplash doesn't skip the welcome screen, btw). However, I noticed that the output of devenv.exe /? in the console listed a slightly different option set, and also there's the /Command switch (which I also read the docs for), and both of these together, combined with past experience, lower my confidence in the completeness of the documentation there. I also found Running the Visual Studio Profiler from the command line but it discusses using the command-line profiler directly; I want to run the graphical profiler in the IDE, though.
If there's no way via devenv.exe, is there maybe some other way to automate this? And if there is a way, the bonus question is: Can I go further than just opening the profiler and actually start profiling given an executable filename or a running PID?
"	"
You can start VS and open the profiler like this:
""C:\Program Files (x86)\Microsoft Visual Studio\2019\Community\Common7\IDE\devenv.exe"" /Command Debug.DiagnosticsHub.Launch

............................................................
It is easy to configure Visual Studio Code to your liking through its various settings. Nearly every part of VS Code's editor, user interface, and functional behavior has options you can modify.
in order to stop the welcome screen do the following things


go to File > Preferences > Settings
search ""Startup Editor""
choose ""None"" from the drop-down menu


in order to edit / make a new screen when app started follow the below steps


go to File > Preferences > Settings
search ""Startup Editor""
choose ""NewUntitleFile"" from the drop-down menu
Setup your own file

I use android studio I downloaded it from the main site and after that I run it and he downloaded sdk files
but I see I saw that I could full download it offline and build apps
my ask
What is the difference between being a program offline or online ?
and how can I full install it offline if it better
"	"
There are actually no differences. The thing is, offline installer is good when you have to download it from internet caffe since you do not have internet connection at home. That's the purpose of offline installer so you can install it on your computer without internet connection. If you have internet connection then go for online installer.

I have installed Delphi 10.3 (Rio) Community Edition on two workstations. Both installations have the same issue.
When I open a Delphi project, none of the source files or form units are opened along with it. I have to either open them manually or via Project > View source and Open file at cursor
I have Delphi 10.4 (Sydney) Professional installed on my company laptop. Here it works as expected; upon opening the project, at least the main form unit is opened along with it.
Is this a setting that I'm overlooking, or is it just the way the community edition IDE works now?
"	"
You can get the IDE to remember which files you have open by checking Project Desktop in Tools->Options->Environment Options->Autosave options.
In Delphi 10.4 Sydney, the setting has been relocated to Tools->Options->IDE->Saving and Desktop->Autosave, where the checkbox is captioned Save project desktop when closing.

In Python3.x, raw_input() and input() are integrated, raw_input() is removed, only the input() function is retained, which receives any input, defaults all input to string processing, and returns the string type.

I'm looking for an IDE that can act like RStudio to develop Python applications in. I love being able to execute code chunks ad-hoc just to see what they do, change it a bit, look at the output again, etc. However, I also want the structure that Pycharm brings, being able to open an entire repo as a project. Does anyone have any recommendations?

Just update you Rstudio , in the newest version of Rstudio , version 1.4 you can develop with python
,
it installs a miniconda environment and then you can develop freely in python , in the environment Tab you will see that you will experience an (""R"" like) experience of programming with Python .

I personally hate Jupyter Notebooks.I'd recommend using Spyder, Pycharm, or VScode with extra emphasis on Spyder because it's python native and allows for remote connections for free (Pycharm is more sophisticated but you have to pay for the version that lets you connect to a remote kernel).
To execute a block of code in Spyder you just highlight what you want to run in the text editor and press f9.Spyder has similar repo/ file management capabilities as Pycharm.

I just recently updated my IntelliJ IDEA to 2020.2 (on Windows; build from July, 27th). What's driving me crazy is that now all my projects use the default path cmd.exe at Settings > Terminal > Shell Path.
Before the update, I have set C:\Program Files\Git\bin\bash.exe there once and it was fine with all my projects.
Now, whenever I open a project for the first time after the update, I have to reconfigure this setting. I haven't found a way yet to configure this globally once and for all, like it was before.

This will be fixed in IntelliJ IDEA 2020.2.1 where the IDE will only use the project-level path for WSL shells. See https://youtrack.jetbrains.com/issue/IDEA-247113 for more information.

I am working with C++ code with ROS2. ROS2 has code style standards and one of the recommended linters is ament_cpplint, which is slightly different from cpplint
Most IDEs/Editors for C++ (Clion, Atom, VS Code, Sublime Text) have plugins for cpplint which will run periodic linter checks as you are editing files. You usually have to set the path to the cpplint executable on your computer. I've tried to set the path to ament_cpplint executable instead but it just won't work. I've tried this with multiple IDEs and plugins by now and none of them will work.
I am not sure what's causing this, Google's cpplint works with IDEs. And I can run $ ament_cpplintfrom the command line just fine, but I can't get it to work in an IDE.
"	"
This might be too late for you, but for others.
You need to pass the path to the cpplint.py executable that is inside the ament_cpplint package.
For ros2 galactic, it is located here:
/opt/ros/galactic/lib/python3.8/site-packages/ament_cpplint/cpplint.py

I'm using Python in PyCharm without any problems. Now I would like to learn R for personal development; but I couldn't manage to set it up into PyCharm. When I click ""New Project"" I can see R Package and R Project; but when I choose R Project I see a message ""Missing R interpreter"". When I try to choose file path: /usr/bin/R, it is empty.
I'm using Kubuntu, I have installed R via terminal. When I write:
which R

The output is:
/usr/bin/R

When I check the path for R folder (/usr/bin), I can't see an R folder there. More awkward is that if I type ""R"" in the terminal, R starts working. I also double checked with another IDE named RKWard where R works perfectly. But I don't want to use more than 1 IDE.

When you write code in Jupyter cells, the notebook (.ipynb) is converted into a JSON object, making it very difficult to work in an IDE.
The solution my company landed on is writing everything in external python modules and importing them into the notebook.We use Jupyter widgets extensively and they can be imported into .py files as easily as importing them into notebooks.In the end, we get a library of custom widgets and modules that can be used by everyone, and since it's just python, we can build/edit in any IDE.I use Sublime.
There may be other ways, but this approach works so well for us that we've stopped looking for alternatives.

My goal is to be able to change the value of a calibration variable externally (using a hexadecimal editor). I have used the Arduino IDE to develop my code.
The variable, defined as a float, is called corrector and is definded as a global variable before the setup(): float corrector;
In the setup() I first define it's value: corrector = 1.0f;
Afterwards, I print the hex address where the variable is located :
Serial.print(""\tAddress: ""); Serial.println((unsigned int)(&corrector), HEX);
The address I get is 309, and when I look at this address at the hex editor what I find is a 30, which means a 0 (wrong because I gave the value of 1 to the variable).
I would appreciate if someone could tell me if I am doing well or not.
Thank you.
"	"
A float value of ""1.0f"" is represented as four bytes 3f800000 (possibly in reversed order if your platform is little-endian) Since this is a global variable without initializer, its address is very probably the runtime address, not the address in the binary.
If you change the definition like this:
float corrector = 1.0f;

You should be able to find those bytes in your binary at the place where the corrector symbol is in your symbol table.

I've decided to use eclipse as my primary IDE for c++ coding but I can't seem to figure out the automatic autocomplete. When I press ctrl + space it shows them just fine but not when I'm typing normally. I tried browsing through the settings but in content assist setting under auto-activation it only has checkboxes for ., ::, and -> triggers and not for letters, numbers and parentheses. I tried browsing around the web and all the solutions were for the java version of the eclipse IDE, not the c++ one.
"	"
I do not think it is possible with the C++ editor. As you described, automatic trigger for content assist only works after typing ., -> or :: (if enabled) and there is no way to make it work for other combinations. See the dialog below:

As you mentioned, Ctrl + Space can always be used to manually launch the tool, but I understand it can become annoying.
So to answer your question: No, it is not possible (for C++).

I am using DataGrip 2020.1.5 and trying to Copy and Paste certain table values from my table (DB is Oracle) to an Excel file.
The portion of values I want to copy is highlighted below.

Values are pasted in a strange format on the Excel; different rows, but all on one column

Paste Format is selected as Tab-seperated (TSV) and I tried to change the settings by Paste Format > Configure CSV Formats... by changing value seperator, but it made no difference.
Column names are also pasted even if I have not ticked the First row is header.
I also tried this copying on both MS Excel 2010 and 2016 still the same output.
I checked about this on the web, also Jetbrains documentation but didn't find anything useful. Perhaps I am missing something here.
Any help would be appreciated, Thanks!
"	"
First, what you are trying to do is to copy values to the clipboard and then paste them to Excel. DataGrip has nothing to do with how Excel pastes values, but DataGrip can copy them in the needed way.
I assume you need TSV format for your data in the clipboard. So you need to copy your values in TSV. To do so, please choose the corresponding extractor in the drop-down:

The option you tick, Paste format, has nothing to do with Excel or any other third party application. It defines in what format you have values when you are pasting into the DataGrip's spreadsheet.

I work in the embedded C programming domain and someone asked me what's the build system of my project. I am working in STM32CubeIDE using |GNU Tools for STM32| toolchain. I didn't have to create a Makefile for my project as it's automatically generated by the IDE. So what is build-system? Is it referring to how I build the project? 

Does the image below have any relevance of the build-system?



Any information will be helpful.
Thanks.
"	"
Since it is set to ""external builder"" and GNU tools, then presumably make - though not necessarily - the IDE could implement its own management rather then explicitly generating and executing a makefile. 

If you are exclusively using the IDE to manage and generate the build for you then ""STM32CubeIDE with GNU Tools"" is probably a reasonable answer too regardless of how it actually implements it. Knowing what tool it uses under the hood is useful if you have to do command line builds for continuous integration or automated release for example.

You can use the LangVersion tag in your Project file, C# language versioning

The latest C# compiler determines a default language version based on
your project's target framework or frameworks. Visual Studio doesn't
provide a UI to change the value, but you can change it by editing the
csproj file.

E.g
<PropertyGroup>
<TargetFramework>netstandard2.1</TargetFramework>
<LangVersion>Latest</LangVersion>
 ...

How can I fix this?

What I'm basically trying to do with this script is to send an email based on a bunch of conditions on a google sheets.
"	"
Solution

In order to be able to run an Apps Script project remotely from your local machine, you need to use the clasp command run as you will be required to also use some kind of authorization (you will basically need to connect your local project to your remote Apps Script project and verify it is you the one trying to run it).

Here is a complete guide on how to use this command but just to summarise a bit you basically will need to set up a Project ID and create an OAuth Client ID to then be able to login using the credentials obtained from it clasp login --creds creds.json1. 

This is an example of running a function using the command run: 

clasp run 'functionName'

It shows that there's no method writeTo that takes Filer type as a parameter, even though there's clearly one when you choose Go To > Declaration option. And as I mentioned - it compiles fine. 




I have already tried:


Cleaning and rebuilding project - didn't work
Syncing gradle several times - didn't work
Refreshing gradle project - didn't work
Using File > Invalidate Cache/Restart option - didn't work
Deleting .gradle and .idea folders and syncing once again - didn't work
Deleting my Java Library module from project and from disk and creating it anew with the same classes - didn't work either


Always the same three errors, so I am quite at loss here. I have to mention that this problem occurred once I downgraded JavaPoet version from 1.12.1 to 1.9.0 (Java 7 compability turned out to be crucial for my app version, so higher Java 8 versions are out of question).
My gradle file:

apply plugin: 'java-library'

dependencies {
implementation fileTree(dir: 'libs', include: ['*.jar'])

annotationProcessor 'com.google.auto.service:auto-service:1.0-rc2'
implementation 'com.google.auto.service:auto-service:1.0-rc2'
implementation 'android.arch.persistence.room:runtime:1.1.1'
implementation 'com.squareup:javapoet:1.9.0'
}

sourceCompatibility = 1.7
targetCompatibility = 1.7



It's not a deal-breaker, but it's distracting and annoying. Do you have any idea of what may be the reason for such behavior?
"	"
While I still don't understand what might be the reason, the errors disappeared, once I included the processor module as a project in my main app module, not as a jar.
Basically, I changed this line:

annotationProcessor files('../migrationprocessor/build/libs/migrationprocessor.jar')


To this line:

annotationProcessor project(':migrationprocessor')

I have a WSL (Ubuntu-20.04) and opening a VSCode in WSL mode. I am trying to create a project and folders inside them. I am not able to import the modules of the project. It is giving me ""unable to import"" pylint errors. Below is my folder structure
my_project
|
|- src
|
|- logger_utils
|
|- logger.py
|- driver.py
|- test

Inside my driver.py, if I try to import a method as from src.logger_utils.logger import get_logger, pylint raises a error - Unable to import
This is happening only in WSL mode. But the same is working fine in normal mode. Any fix/suggestions for this issue

This is probably a PYTHONPATH issue. In your VScode settings for your workspace, add the following:

In Visual Studio, Intellisense is smart enough to know that the 'out' variable value in Dictionary<string, string>.TryGetValue(string key, out string value) is not null if the method returns true:

I'm trying to emulate this with the following example, but I don't know what to do. How can I give Intellisense the hint that the out variable result in TryGetString() will not be null if the method returns true?
Note: I still want the nullability check to appear when the TryGetString() method returns false, the same way it works with Dictionary<string, string>.TryGetValue(string key, out string value)
public class TestClass
{
private int Number = 3;
private bool TryGetString(out string? result)
{
// 'result' is null if this method returns 'false'
if (Number > -1)
{
result = Number.ToString();
return true;
}
result = null;
return false;
}
public void Init()
{
if (TryGetString(out var result))
{
string a = result; // Visual Studio gives a null warning here,
 // even though 'result' is not null inside
 // this code block.
}
}
}

"	"
There are a number of attributes in the System.Diagnostics.CodeAnalysis namespace that can be used to provide information to the compiler's code analyzer.
To indicate that an out parameter is not null when the return value is true, use the [NotNullWhen] attribute:
private bool TryGetString([NotNullWhen(returnValue: true)] out string? result)

I know what preprocessing is, how compiler works, and how linker links the object files
But what I still haven't been able to answer is :
In an IDE like VS
suppose we have a library called DariushTest.o that implemented a function called print() and have a header file called test.h
and we have other libraries that implemented the print() function
but we don't include their header files in our code
suppose we include the test.h header in our code and we use the print() function in our main function
NOW! if there are several libraries that have implemented this function.
after compiling the code, how does the linker find out which library this code is related to and with which file should it link?
The reason that I ask this question is that the header file doesn't connect to DariushTest.o file and the compiler doesn't care about it.
So how linker links the print() function from DariushTest.o not from other libraries?
How the linker find the correct library?
"	"
So how linker links the print() function from DariushTest.o not from other libraries?
It doesn't. If you break the ODR by having the same function name in 2 different compilation units, then the behavior of the program is undefined. The linker might notice and diagnose the redefinition and might not.

I have a very simple scipt do read a csv and plot using pandas and matplotlib.
When it is ran in PyCharm it reads all the rows (only around 425), but when ran in terminal it only reads 3 lines and plots that.
Does anyone have an idea why?
Here is my code:
import pandas
import matplotlib.pyplot as plt

df = pandas.read_csv('data.csv', delimiter=',',names=['Value', 'Date'])
print(df)

df.plot(kind='scatter', x='Date', y='Value')

plt.show()

"	"
It's very easy to end up with more than one file called ""data.csv"", so you can end up with your IDE using a different file to the file used on a prompt.
One way round this is to give the full path for any file you open.
You can also check where the debugger in your IDE is running - there will be an option for the current working directory.

My JetBrains WebStorm gone crazy and started to save files right after I type the character. Autosave settings are disabled (I like to save files manually). Any ideas why this could happen or how to fix it?
"	"
WebStorm doesn't normally auto-save files on each key pressing. If it only happens while debugging your app, check if Live Edit (that is active during debug session) is enabled in Preferences | Build, Execution, Deployment | Debugger | Live Edit - it auto-saves files to provide live reload. Some other plugins can also be responsible for auto-saving - for example, third-party SonarLint and ESLint plugins are known for causing such issues, as they save files to run analysis on the changes, Flow service, when enabled, flashes files to disk to submit up-to-date files to Flow type checker, etc.
I'd also suggest to check if you have any file watchers set up in Preferences | Tools | File Watchers - those watchers that have Auto-save edited files to trigger the watcher enabled can cause auto-saving of the files included in watcher scope

I've got a C++ project in which I can open up any .cpp or .h, and the LSP will crash/fail (I'm using emacs with lsp-mode).
For instance if I try to open a file called IDictionary.h, clangd will fail with the following errors in the clangd::stderr buffer

Anyways, this happens for every single file in the project, even ones as simple as
#include ""stdafx.h""
using namespace Api;

My assumption was that some file being pulled in by the build/compile_commands.json is screwing everything up, but I can't be sure. VSCode (which I assume is using an LSP, though I know it has its own tricks) doesn't have any issues on my project at all.
Anyways, I was hoping that someone could point me towards some more detailed clangd or ccls logs, and maybe some commands which could get me some more informative error messages or validate files in my project
"	"
The issue appears to be fixed on the latest versions of clangd (11.0) and ccls (0.20190823.6-26-g141aea8a)
Sam McCall over on the LLVM discord also had this to say

You can get a bit more info by adding -log=verbose to the clangd args, and providing more of the log (things that might be relevant include version, path, preamble build, ...).
I don't know much about windows stdafx, but I understand it pulls in a lot of stuff, some of which may have tickled a bug in that version.

I had this working before, and I am 99% positive I have been following the same procedure I have used in the past of adding the lib to the project file structure, adding VM options in the Edit Configurations menu. For some reason I still cannot get JavaFX to work with my setup the way it did in the past. My old projects still run and were written with the same libraries and Java version. I have been banging my head on the wall with this issue all morning, I feel as though the solution may be sitting right in front of me. I have no clue what else to try from here, Reddit has been useless and everything I've searched has been the same.
I have tried running with both, when I took the VM options out the last time I finally got my errors in the editor to go away, but get the errors I had in the original post, this is why I didn't include them in the ZIP but included them in the post.

Your project is using Java 14, even though you initially specified Java 11 in the question.
Per the documentation when using Java 14 the following VM Options are also needed:
--add-exports javafx.graphics/com.sun.javafx.sg.prism=ALL-UNNAMED

in addition to these options:
--module-path /home/(myUser)/Downloads/javafx-sdk-15.0.1/lib --add-modules=javafx.controls,javafx.fxml

Double check all the options are specified in the VM Options field of the Run Configuration, not in the Program Arguments.

I've created several internal add-ons to automate a few workflows within our company using the ""old"" Apps Script IDE. Now I'd like to create a new one using the all new Apps Script IDE which was released last december. All looks good and works great, however there's a few things I can't figure out.
First off: using deployments the Google Workspace Marketplace IDE states that ""Your deployment ID will identify all the Google Workspace services that your app supports."" when using a deploymeny ID. So, I've pasted my deployment ID in there. Just a simple script creating an add-on menu and running a function resulting in an alert:
function onInstall () {
onOpen()
}

function onOpen () {
var ui = SpreadsheetApp.getUi()
var menu = ui.createAddonMenu()

// Create menu structure
menu
.addItem('Create proposal', 'proposalShowPopup')

// Add menu to UI
menu.addToUi()
}

function proposalShowPopup() {
Browser.msgBox('Test')
}

However, when I deploy this, I can see the listing in the marketplace, but I can't install it in the sheets where I need it.
Furthermore, probably because I haven't declared this add-on to be a Sheets add-on, I can't install the test-deployment as mentioned in this article:
Testing Google Workspace add-ons by Google. The Install is missing from the Apps Script's Deployments dialog.
I read a lot about the appsscript.json file but can't find any information on what this file should contain other than the following lines of code, applicable to my script:
{
""timeZone"": ""Europe/Paris"",
""dependencies"": {
""enabledAdvancedServices"": [
{
""userSymbol"": ""Sheets"",
""version"": ""v4"",
""serviceId"": ""sheets""
}
]
},
""exceptionLogging"": ""STACKDRIVER"",
""runtimeVersion"": ""V8""
}

Any ideas on how to create an Sheets only add-on using the new IDE (which works great as mentioned before)?
Any help or nudges in the right direction would be appreciated.
"	"
The reason you cannot install the add-on in Sheets is essentially because you are not declaring in your manifest anything about the script being an add-on.
Since you want it to be specifically used in Sheets, the manifest appscript.json file should look something similar to this:
{
""timeZone"": ""Europe/Paris"",
""dependencies"": {
""enabledAdvancedServices"": [
{
""userSymbol"": ""Sheets"",
""version"": ""v4"",
""serviceId"": ""sheets""
}
]
},
""exceptionLogging"": ""STACKDRIVER"",
""runtimeVersion"": ""V8"",
""addOns"": {
""sheets"": {
""homepageTrigger"": {
""runFunction"": ""proposalShowPopup""
}
}
}
}

Notice that the addOns parameter has been added as well as with the sheets paramater.
The addOns parameter has the following structure and it represents the configuration that is used to define the add-on's content and behavior.
{
""common"": {
object (Common)
},
""calendar"": {
object (Calendar)
},
""drive"": {
object (Drive)
},
""gmail"": {
object (Gmail)
},
""docs"": {
object (Docs)
},
""sheets"": {
object (Sheets)
},
""slides"": {
object (Slides)
}
}

As for the sheets parameter it has the below structure - which is similar to the one most of the parameters from the addOns have; however, since you mention it as being sheets this will clearly indicate for which of these add-on types is meant for.
{
""homepageTrigger"": {
object (HomepageTrigger)
},
""onFileScopeGrantedTrigger"": {
object (OnFileScopeGrantedTrigger)
}
}

After setting your manifest file accordingly, you should be able to see the Install button pop up when going to Test Deployments:

In the Delphi 10.4 IDE Form Designer's STRUCTURE PANEL, I select a TCard container control (containing several controls) and try to copy it to the clipboard with CTRL+C. It does not work. Even in the EDIT sub-context menu, the Copy item is disabled:

Is there a trick to do this? Is this a bug in the IDE?

There seems to be a bug in the IDE that interrupts the synchronization between Structure Panel and Form Designer for specific object types like TCard or TTabSheet and similar containers.
This is a workaround for this bug:

First select the TCard in the Structure Panel

Then click on the Form Designer's TABto focus the TCard in the Form Designer

Then press CTRL+C to copy the TCard together with all its sub-controls to the clipboard - this works!

I want to change the signature of a function in the Python module, which has been used many times in the current project.
If you use the refactoring feature of IDEA (with Python plug-in), changing the function name can take effect within the scope of the whole project; but changing the signature can't, and don't see this option of scope.
Go to Google to search the relevant content, did not find more useful information.
Does IDEA really have no way to intelligently change the signature of functions in the whole project scope?
If the answer is No, are there any other solutions?
Note: Of course, regular expressions can also be used. This option is already known.
"	"
You can't set the range like renaming, it's not quite clear what the exact range is, but it's definitely not limited to the current file.
If it only takes effect in the current file, then the correct parsing relationship is probably not established, then you should Find Usages ( Control+left mouse button is the default shortcut), check it, and if you find any errors, can use File | Invalidate Caches to try to clear the cache and restart IDE.
Thanks LazyOne.

In the Project View, when there are so many files, it's time consuming to collapse and expand and navigate through all the items. How can I search for files in the project?
I have searched for it online many times, but most of them explain the Ctrl + Shift + F which actually searches for terms in all the files in the current project, this is convenient but yet it's not what I'm looking for.
I want to search for actual files in the project and not terms within them. I don't know if this feature is available by default in WebStorm (which so obviously should, and don't know why many IDEs don't have it), but please mention any plugins that emulate this functionality.

To search for a file by name, try using Navigate > File or Search Everywhere (Shift+Shift, or the magnifying glass icon on the main toolbar). See https://www.jetbrains.com/help/webstorm/2021.1/searching-everywhere.html#ws_search_files
Note also that the Project tool window has a quick search - just focus it and start entering the file name

I loaded a project on Spring-tool Suite but I realized that it does not correct the errors. Going to see Properties I realized that all the parameters related to the JavaBuilder that I have in the other loaded projects were missing. I think it's a Jdk problem, but I don't know how to set everything up or how to reset the project in order to have the error corrected.
thanks to anyone who can help me!

I think you need to delete the .metadata folder in your workspace.
............................................................
The problem was Spring-Tool itself which had a bug where it didn't show any kind of error. There are two ways to get around the problem: delete the project from Spring-boot, delete the Workspace and reload everything. In case it is also recommended to download Spring-boot tool Suite again. In the second case it could be an error importing the project, try to import it to Intellij or another IDEE and see if you have the same problems. If you have the same problems it is a problem of loading the java libraries. To solve it you should open another project where you have no problems and once opened, go to FILE-> NEW-> IMPORT PROJECT and import your project.

Delphi sets the name of components when you add them to a form. The first TButton will be named ""Button1"" the second ""Button2"" and so on.
A while ago I discovered by accident that you can change this ""prefix"". Staying with TButton I changed it to ""btn"" so TButtons will be named ""btn1"", ""btn2"" and so on.
Now I want to change some more component prefixes but unfortunately I forgot how to do this. It could be some functionality of GExperts. Anybody to the rescue?
Just if it is important: I'm using Delphi 10.2.

In GExperts it's called ""Rename Components"":

In V8 at least, in the debugger, you see local, script and global categorizing the variables.

I got a reference to global. All you do for that is set this on entry to a property to use later if need be.
However, I can't find how to save a reference to the script object. I think it exists because that's what the debugger is looping through in the watch window.
"	"
Before ES6, All declarations outside a function (and function declaration themselves) were properties of global object.After ES6, There are twokinds of global records:



Object record- Same as ES5. 


Function declarations 
Function generators 
Variable assignments var 

Declarative record - New 


let, const, class, etc




Those in the declarative record are not accessible fromthe global ""object"", though they are globals themselves. They are accessible from the script, but the object/internal data structure holding the declarative records itself is not accessible or enumerable from inside the script. This declarative record is shown in v8 debugger as properties of script object.

If there's only one tab on an editor in VS Code, the default behavior is to close the editor right then and there.
Personally, and I think many others agree with me, this behavior is very annoying since the programmer would rather preserve the layout he or she created for the project's workspace.
How do I change this behavior?
I've found discussions on this topic, but all of the solutions do not seem to be the ideal one of simply leaving the editor open but empty. Most of them simply delete the related shortcuts, which seems to me like cutting your arm off just because you broke it.
Anyway, here are some useful links:

Superuser StackExchange: How to prevent VScode from closing editor when pressing ctrl+w with no tabs open?
Issue #54492: Remove CtrlCmd+W keybinding to close window when no editors are opened

"	"
If what you are looking for is to preserve empty groups as well as empty editor windows, there is an option in the preferences that gets you almost all of the way:
""workbench.editor.closeEmptyGroups"": false

This has the effect that an editor group will stay open even if the last tab within it is closed.
............................................................

The behavior of the shortcut ctrl+w is as-designed closing the application

Actually, VSCode 1.57 (May 2021) will change that:

Removed Cmd+W / Ctrl+W as keybinding to close window when no editor is opened
We have gotten feedback that users are frustrated when the window suddenly closes after having closed the last editor via rapid Cmd+W / Ctrl+W usages.
A quick poll in the team also revealed that many had the keybinding for closing a window unassigned, so we went ahead and removed Cmd+W / Ctrl+W as keybinding to close window when no editor is opened.

You can easily bring the keybinding back by configuring it as follows:

{
 ""key"": ""cmd+w"", // use ""ctrl+w"" on windows
 ""command"": ""workbench.action.closeWindow"",
 ""when"": ""!editorIsOpen && !multipleEditorGroups""
}

Note: on all platforms there is a dedicated assigned keybinding to close the window:

macOS: Cmd+Shift+W
Linux: Alt+F4
Windows: Alt+F4


............................................................

but all of the solutions do not seem to be the ideal one of simply leaving the editor open but empty

Reddit has an answer providing you the ideal solution of leaving the editor open, but empty: close all tabs but leave editors open.
In brief, they suggest to use in rapid succession the ""close all editors"" and the ""three column editor layout"".
They suggest to create a macro like:
""macros"": {
""closeAllTabs"": [
""workbench.action.closeAllEditors"",
""workbench.action.editorLayoutThreeColumns""
]
}

then bind it to a key combination. macrosRe is advised.
The behavior of the shortcut ctrl+w is as-designed closing the application, see #49023. It is advisable to remove the shortcut and cut the arm, since it is design to work like that. However, for version 1.43.1 a new comment was posted this year on a thread you linked. You might want to have a look at it as well.

I'm new to Java hence the question that seems dumb.

When I was using CodeBlocks for C, there were two options: build and run.

But in eclipse, I see 3 three: build, run, run as. Both run and run as seems to do the same thing.

What is the difference?
"	"
I'm still pretty new to programming myself, so there's certainly more to it than I can tell you, but basically, ""Run as"" gives you a few more options than simply ""Run"".

Once you start building more complex applications that use dependency management services (like Maven) or frameworks (like Spring) there will be options to choose from when you click ""Run as"". Since you (presumably) don't have any of that yet, the buttons do the same for you.

I think by default visual studio does keep your files/tabs open for a specific solution that you are working on even after you've closed it, however, I must have done something to change that.

I am transitioning from using PyCharm to VS Code and noticed that autocomplete in VS Code is not seemingly as useful as it is in PyCharm.

In PyCharm, once a function is defined within your project, PyCharm's autocomplete will display all the arguments that function takes. Is that possible in VS Code?
In PyCharm, even unknown/unimportable modules (such as those defined in an API) will appear as potential completions if that completion has been used somewhere else in the project. Are there ""project"" level settings in VS Code to enable this? Is this learning behavior possible through intellisense?

"	"
1) Intellisense displaying all the arguments of a function: Yes. This is how it shows me
 

2) Intellisense showing potential completion of modules: Yup. I hope this is what you mean.


3) If you are referring to settings that only work in your current project, Yes. You need to save your workspace first (go to File>Save Workspace As ..., and then head over to the workspace settings by using Ctrl+Shift+P and search for Workspace settings. 

I hope I understood your queries correctly.

It seems that you are yet to set up your python intellisense. Try going according to the tutorial here. https://code.visualstudio.com/docs/languages/python

I have to develop an iOS app for college project. On my Mac the Xcode command line tool is installed. I dont want to use the Xcode GUI as it performs very laggy. 

My question is, for iOS ap development do I really need the Xcode GUI downloaded from Mac app store, or the command line interface is sufficient?
"	"
""I dont want to use the Xcode GUI as it performs very laggy.""

Not necessarily true.

First, there is a big difference between Xcode GUI and Xcode IDE

If you don't like the GUI portion for UI development - i.e. using Storyboard / Interface Builder - you don't have to use that feature at all.

If you don't like the IDE as a whole (code-completion, formatting, integrated help, build-run-debug, etc, etc) you don't have to use that either.

For example, you can write your entire app with TextEdit and build it from the command line... if you really wanted to.

However, you do have to have the SDK installed, and the best way of doing that (probably the only practical way) is to install Xcode ... but again, you can use any text/code editor you like, and then use the command-line tools for building.
............................................................
yes you need to, everything that you need to make an app is on the XCode IDE.

I certainly know how to use the line comment shortcut, ctrl + /, but for some reason the comment starts at the end of line.

If I start with this code:

if (something) {
return 5;
}


And use the shortcut from IntelliJ, I end up with:

if (something) {
//return 5;
}


But I expect things to look like this:

if (something)
// return 5;
}

You can't directly run Linux shell scripts on Windows. You do have a few options, however:


Run your script through Cygwin
Run your script in mintty (this is the shell included with Git for Windows, is called Git Bash in the context menu)
Run your script under WSL (Windows Subsystem for Linux)
Port the script to another language you can run on Windows




For 1 and 2, it'll be on you to make sure any dependencies for the script are available in either Cygwin or mintty.

For 3, after making sure WSL is set up you can run a single command under WSL: wsl script.sh arg1 arg2 argX.

I would recommend option 3 or 4. 3 may offer the best experience in terms of compatibility and ease of set up (without porting the script) as Cygwin and mintty can be a pain to set up dependencies in. Option 4 would be best though as long as you are well-versed in both PowerShell and shell scripts and can transpose the equivalent calls from one to the other.

Is there a way to make it replace every line by accounting for the 1-60 at the end?
"	"
I discovered a solution, although @usmanhaq's is better if third-party software can be installed.I'm adding it here for future users who stumble into the same problem I did:

In the Replace feature (CTRL-H), with Pattern Recognition On, have VBA find this line:
ActiveWindow.ScrollColumn = [1-9]?

And Replace it with nothing. Then repeat it without the ? at the end.
The first iteration will check anything with two digits (between 10-99), and the second iteration with no wildcard (?) will replace anything with 1 digit (0-9).
Unfortunately, it seems that the Find & Replace feature isn't capable of searching or recognizing line breaks, so this is only able to replace those lines with white space.That does make it easier to remove, but @usmanhaq's solution would be able to remove them entirely.
............................................................

Download Notepad++
Paste the code in the editor
Press Ctrl+H (to find and replace)
Check the Search Mode to Regular Expression
in search Field enter ActiveWindow.ScrollColumn = [0-9]*
If you want to reomove full line, you can enter ActiveWindow.ScrollColumn = [0-9]*$\r\n in the search field
and in replace field enter nothing.

I'm on Windows 10 and recently updated to Spyder 5.3.3 standalone version and the keyboard shortcut to switch to the editor pane (default Ctrl+E) will not work no matter what I try, it simply has no effect.
I've tried reinstalling Spyder, resetting everything back to defaults multiple times, changing to different keyboard shortcuts than Ctrl+E, trying to switch to the editor pane while having various other panes selected (different contexts), but nothing helps. I can switch to all other panes (like the console with Ctrl+I, etc) just fine and so far all of the other key shortcuts I'm used to work but this one is the most impactful and I can't get it to work. I opened my previous version of Spyder 4.X and the Ctrl+E works fine from any context as expected.

It is basically this issue.
While using code like
class SomeComponent extends React.Component {

}

export default withRouter(SomeComponent);

I can't use search usages properly, because it obviously finds the export line.
It can be hacked in functional components like this:
const SomeComponent = withRouter((props) => {
 //...component here
});
export default SomeComponent;

but gets very ugly when using redux for example:
const mapStateToProps = (state, ownProps) => ({
....
});

const SomeComponent = connect(mapStateToProps)({
cartPhotos,
digitals,
balancePrice,
photolabPrice,
digitalsPrice,
voucher,
photosPrice,
deliveryPrice,
totalPrice,
openPhotolabModal,
isSidebar,
}) => {

});
export default SomeComponent;

My questions are:

Is there a way to overcome this without using such ugly approach?
Is there a way to overcome this on a class component AT ALL?

It's normal that you find only one ref for SomeComponent.
SomeComponent !==your default export
If you press right click on default and search there usages you find all that use it in import.

Original Question

What I'd like is not a standard C pre-processor, but a variation on it which would accept from somewhere - probably the command line via -DNAME1 and -UNAME2 options - a specification of which macros are defined, and would then eliminate dead code.

It may be easier to understand what I'm after with some examples:

#ifdef NAME1
#define ALBUQUERQUE ""ambidextrous""
#else
#define PHANTASMAGORIA ""ghostly""
#endif


If the command were run with '-DNAME1', the output would be:

#define ALBUQUERQUE ""ambidextrous""


If the command were run with '-UNAME1', the output would be:

#define PHANTASMAGORIA ""ghostly""


If the command were run with neither option, the output would be the same as the input.

This is a simple case - I'd be hoping that the code could handle more complex cases too.

To illustrate with a real-world but still simple example:

#ifdef USE_VOID
#ifdef PLATFORM1
#define VOID void
#else
#undef VOID
typedef voidVOID;
#endif /* PLATFORM1 */
typedef void *VOIDPTR;
#else
typedef mint VOID;
typedef char *VOIDPTR;
#endif /* USE_VOID */


I'd like to run the command with -DUSE_VOID -UPLATFORM1 and get the output:

#undef VOID
typedef voidVOID;
typedef void *VOIDPTR;


Another example:

#ifndef DOUBLEPAD
#if (defined NT) || (defined OLDUNIX)
#define DOUBLEPAD 8
#else
#define DOUBLEPAD 0
#endif /* NT */
#endif /* !DOUBLEPAD */


Ideally, I'd like to run with -UOLDUNIX and get the output:

#ifndef DOUBLEPAD
#if (defined NT)
#define DOUBLEPAD 8
#else
#define DOUBLEPAD 0
#endif /* NT */
#endif /* !DOUBLEPAD */


This may be pushing my luck!

Motivation: large, ancient code base with lots of conditional code.Many of the conditions no longer apply - the OLDUNIX platform, for example, is no longer made and no longer supported, so there is no need to have references to it in the code.Other conditions are always true.For example, features are added with conditional compilation so that a single version of the code can be used for both older versions of the software where the feature is not available and newer versions where it is available (more or less).Eventually, the old versions without the feature are no longer supported - everything uses the feature - so the condition on whether the feature is present or not should be removed, and the 'when feature is absent' code should be removed too.I'd like to have a tool to do the job automatically because it will be faster and more reliable than doing it manually (which is rather critical when the code base includes 21,500 source files).

(A really clever version of the tool might read #include'd files to determine whether the control macros - those specified by -D or -U on the command line - are defined in those files.I'm not sure whether that's truly helpful except as a backup diagnostic.Whatever else it does, though, the pseudo-pre-processor must not expand macros or include files verbatim.The output must be source similar to, but usually simpler than, the input code.)

Status Report (one year later)

After a year of use, I am very happy with 'sunifdef' recommended by the selected answer.It hasn't made a mistake yet, and I don't expect it to.The only quibble I have with it is stylistic.Given an input such as:

#if (defined(A) && defined(B)) || defined(C) || (defined(D) && defined(E))


and run with '-UC' (C is never defined), the output is:

#if defined(A) && defined(B) || defined(D) && defined(E)


This is technically correct because '&&' binds tighter than '||', but it is an open invitation to confusion.I would much prefer it to include parentheses around the sets of '&&' conditions, as in the original:

#if (defined(A) && defined(B)) || (defined(D) && defined(E))


However, given the obscurity of some of the code I have to work with, for that to be the biggest nit-pick is a strong compliment; it is valuable tool to me.



The New Kid on the Block

Having checked the URL for inclusion in the information above, I see that (as predicted) there is an new program called Coan that is the successor to 'sunifdef'.It is available on SourceForge and has been since January 2010.I'll be checking it out...further reports later this year, or maybe next year, or sometime, or never.
"	"
I know absolutely nothing about C, but it sounds like you are looking for something like unifdef. Note that it hasn't been updated since 2000, but there is a successor called ""Son of unifdef"" (sunifdef).
............................................................
Also you can try this tool http://coan2.sourceforge.net/

something like this will remove ifdef blocks:

coan source -UYOUR_FLAG--filter c,h --recurse YourSourceTree
............................................................
I used unifdef years ago for just the sort of problem you describe, and it worked fine.Even if it hasn't been updated since 2000, the syntax of preprocessor ifdefs hasn't changed materially since then, so I expect it will still do what you want.I suppose there might be some compile problems, although the packages appear recent.

I've never used sunifdef, so I can't comment on it directly.
............................................................
Around 2004 I wrote a tool that did exactly what you are looking for.I never got around to distributing the tool, but the code can be found here: 

http://casey.dnsalias.org/exifdef-0.2.zip (that's a dsl link)

It's about 1.7k lines and implements enough of the C grammar to parse preprocessor statements, comments, and strings using bison and flex.
............................................................
If you need something similar to a preprocessor, the flexible solution is Wave (from boost). It's a library designed to build C-preprocessor-like tools (including such things as C++03 and C++0x preprocessors). As it's a library, you can hook into its input and output code.

I have a good android mobile device and I'm looking for a way to build android apps using Kotlin. And I don't want to use an IDE. Is there a way to install/download all necessary tools/resources/whatever to my device to make it possible? Thanks
"	"
I think you can use the command line for do so.

Gradle contains the tasks for creating a proyect, compile, debugging, generating APK/App Bundle, Run in emmulator, etc... but, in Android Studio this was simplified in some way for productivity reasons (imho).

But, If you still want to use the command line with gradle, you can set gradle home /bin folder in the PATH env variables for the OS you use, and then you can apply for work with that.

BTW, Strongly recommend to check this link from the official documentation.

I downloaded an app from GitHub but it does not include an APK file. I am using an Android device and I do not have access to Android Studio. How would I used aide or something else to build the app? (GitHub page: https://github.com/mumumusuc/joycon-toolkit)
"	"
You have apk files in the Release bundles: https://github.com/mumumusuc/joycon-toolkit/releases (click on assets to expand).
............................................................
As far as I know, it is not possible. Because there is no other way to compile the code of Android Studio to make it runnable. And the link which you have shared is not an Android Studio Code it is Flutter Code. Which requires a different environment than Android Studio.

If you really need that software create an issue on Github and ask developer for the link.
............................................................
Clone the repository, open it in VScode, in terminal type flutter build apk ( if you have PC or laptop ) otherwise on phone i dont think its doable.

usually when I do ctrl + <left click> on a method name it'll take me to it's definition. If I have multiple implementations of that function with different arguments it will ask me to select a declaration. At run-time how can I tell which method declaration will be executed? 

So far I've tried going into debug mode and viewing it that way to no avail. I know I could put breakpoints in each implementation to see which instances are run, but it seems like there's a better way to accomplish this. Thanks in advance for any help!
"	"
Try to use Step Into action (Run - Debugging Actions - Step Into or F7), it will navigate you into the actual implementation.

Some debugging actions are described in https://www.jetbrains.com/help/pycharm/stepping-through-the-program.html.

So I just created a simple script with selenium that automates the login for my University's portal. The first reaction I got from a friend was: ah nice, you can put that on my pc as well. That would be rather hard as he'd have to install python and run it through an IDE or through his terminal or something like that and the user friendliness wouldn't be optimal.

Is there a way that I could like wrap it in a nicer user interface, maybe create an app or something so that I could just share that program? All they'd have to do is then fill in their login details once and the program then logs them in every time they want. I have no clue what the possibilities for that are, therefore I'm asking this question. 

And more in general, how do I get to use my python code outside of my IDE? Thusfar, I've created some small projects and ran them in PyCharm and that's it. Once again, I have no clue what the possibilities are so I also don't really know what I'm asking. If anyone gets what I mean by using my code further than only in my IDE, I'd love to hear your suggestions!
"	"
The IDE running you program is the same as you running your program in the console. But if you dont want them to have python installed (and they have windows) you can maybe convert them to exe with py2exe. But if they have linux, they probably have python installed and can run you program with ""python script.py"". But tell your friends to install python, if they program or not, it will always come in handy

I'm running code quite frequently when working in PyCharm. Problem is that the entire code manipulates data temporarily stored in excel (we'll be moving this to the database once the program is up and running). Loading data takes time.

Is there a way in PyCharm to keep variable in the initial memory (without running a piece of code in the console) even after the program finished running? 

data = pd.read_excel(path, index_col=0)


I want to avoid reloading data every time I am running program.
"	"
No, this feature has not been implemented yet and there is no way to do this.
............................................................
If working in PyCharm is not a neccesity, you could work in a jupyter notebook: https://jupyter.org/ 
You could load your data in a cell and work with it in the next cells. Once executed, the result of a cell is kept in memory.
............................................................
I've found a dirty trick - I am aware this is a very, very non-pythonic and not appropriate way of doing this. But it does the trick for me in this example. Again this code is only temporarily used for testing and will be removed once I'm happy with the code.

Module I run is as follow:

data = pd.read_excel(path, index_col=0) #Data is loaded only once

while True:
reload(TestModule)
TestModule.test_function(data)
input(""Press Enter to rerun the test"")


Now in TestModule I have test_function where I can reload ModyfiedModule I am working on and any function I want to test.

TestModule:

def test_function(data):
from ModyfiedModule import MyClass

#Run bunch of tests from MyClass
#Code to test MyClass is here


In this case, I load data only once and I can modify MyClass module and perform various test defined in TestModule without need to reload data each time.

The only thing I need to do after modifying code is to save MyClass and TestModule and press Enter in the console to rerun the test.

Go to the ""terminal""(for PyCharm)/""console""(for Spyder) of the IDE you are using, and install the packages using pip in that terminal, it should work!

I have to work on a folder that has multiple subfolders and all in all there are over 150 files. This includes php, css, js, and image files. My focus is on php.

Quite frankly, I am a little overwhelmed. 
How can I have an overview of which files import functions/classes from another file. That way I can see the connections between different files in this forest and allow me to better navigate through this jungle.

I tried printing tree in cmd to get an idea of the file structure:

â”œâ”€â”€â”€core
â”?â”œâ”€â”€â”€assets
â”?â”?â”œâ”€â”€â”€css
â”?â”?â”œâ”€â”€â”€extra


etc.

I went quickly through most of the files and took notes what they are. My problem is that going through over 10,000 lines of code to find the connections will take me forever. Are there any tools in the IDE that help or do you guys have any other ideas?

Up until recently I could select the startup project (equivalent to right-clicking on the project in the solution explorer and choosing ""Set as Startup Project"") from the Standard toolbar with the ""Select Startup Item"" drop-down.Now it's gone, yet the item is still checked under ""Add or Remove Buttons"".

The closest reference I could find is this, but the solution doesn't match my situation because I have more than one project and this is happening no matter which solution is loaded.

Please help me figure out what is going on.

I had a similar issue where the start menu item (called ""Debug Target"") was completely gone. Toggling the menu item on and off did not resolve the issue. I selected ""Reset Toolbar"" at the bottom of the menu and that resolved the problem for me. May require some manual set up after if your menu is heavily customized. But if you use the Standard layout it shouldn't be an issue.

............................................................
I had the same problem. The ""Startup Projects"" drop-down disappeared occasionally. It was probably caused by installing/uninstallin/updating VS extensions.
The solution was easy. Install free extension Clear MEF Component Cache. Then simply click the Clear MEF Component Cache in the Tools menu. The toolbar should be repaired after restating Visual Studio.
This solution does NOT reset any of your UI customizations.

In fact, it only seems to randomly reveal file matches that I've recently opened or opened the parent folder of. What's with this random behavior? I tried closing and re-opening vscode to no avail.

I want to install Python on my windows 10 64 bit
However I cant figure out which IDE is best for GUI application building
I've tried using ActivePython but its not compatible with x64 processors
I want to use both Matplotlib and Tkinter in my program
So which IDE is best for the same purpose??
Furthermore what is the stepwise procedure to install environment for the same??
Is separate Python installation required after installing any IDE??
e.g., if I install Jupyter/Spyder on my PC, is there any requirement to download Python 3.9 setup from python.org??
"	"
I personally recommend PyCharm community edition. It's a free IDE and it is great because it allows you to integrate anaconda environments by default. Yes, you will have to install python and anaconda, but once you get it setup, it's a great IDE to work in.
Pycharm can support any version of Windows (x86, x64), Linux or Mac. Installing it is simple, first install the python installer, then the anaconda installer, then go to this website (Pycharm download location) and once the installer is downloaded, run it and select your preferences. To setup an environment, anaconda has a built in navigation tool which allows you to edit environments, but Pycharm will also allow you to set it up within the IDE.

I have been using ScriptApp.getService().getUrl() server side to return the current dev or prod (exec) url to the client side. I do this so that I can provide a ""permalink"" or copy URL function so that users can link to a specific record in the app. Something like:
https://script.google.com/macros/s/{ID}/exec?recordId=999

Recently, when Google rolled out the new IDE, I started having a problem where ScriptApp.getService().getUrl() returns only the Legacy URL.
I was able to recreate this with a new project, so maybe this is a new IDE bug?
Steps to Recreate

Create a new App Script Project.
Make sure you select ""Use Legacy Editor""
Create an app that displays the URL

Index.html
<!DOCTYPE html>
<html>
<head>
<base target=""_top"">
 <script src=""https://code.jquery.com/jquery-1.12.4.js""></script>
</head>
<body>
<h2>Hello World 2</h2>
<div id='test'>xx</div>
<script>
$(document).ready(function() {
google.script.run.withSuccessHandler(success).getUrl();
});

function success(url) {
$(""#test"").html(url);
}
</script>
</body>
</html>

Code.gs
function doGet() {
return HtmlService.createHtmlOutputFromFile('Index');
}

function getUrl(){
Logger.log(ScriptApp.getService().getUrl());
return ScriptApp.getService().getUrl();
}


Menu Publish -> Deploy as Web App (old IDE).
Open the new deployed app, and confirm that the URL on screen is the same as the URL you're hitting.
Menu Publish -> Deploy as Web App, click ""Latest Code"" link to get to dev.
Verify it shows the correct dev URL.
Click ""Use new Editor"" button to switch to new IDE.
Click Deploy -> New Deployment.
Enter a description and click ""Deploy""
Now open the new URL that is published.
Note how the URL in the address bar and the URL on the page from the getURL call are different: on Page is the same as the old IDE URL.

So the question is: How do I get Google to completely archive the old URL?
"	"
(my response from issue tracker, here for reference https://issuetracker.google.com/issues/170799249#comment26)
In legacy editor user had to save new project version and then publish it (or do it at once)
There were two links: dev (head) and published version with static link (web app meta-version)
In a new editor, every time project is deployed it gets a new ID and new link but web app meta-version is not updated. There is no way to control this published with the static link version (web app meta-version). So bookmarks and reverences point to the old version or are broken if this version was archived. This is BAD!
ScriptApp.getService().getUrl() seems to always return the same static link to web app meta-version. This what is confusing OP IMHO.
Workaround that worked for me: switch to legacy editor, publish (deploy as web app) the latest (or required) version. It will became web app meta-version reachable by the same old link. I assume the same returned by ScriptApp.getService().getUrl(). Not sure about dev link.
............................................................
Few days ago Google make it possible to create and assign a version to a deployment.

I really like PyCharm's SQL inspections, they are really useful and give valuable insights. But they don't work well with psycopg2 SQL composition features. I'm building a simple query to perform multiple rows insert:
from psycopg2.sql import SQL, Placeholder, Literal

def build_materials_insert(model_id, materials):
data = SQL("", "").join(
SQL(""({model_id}, {obj_name}, {material})"").format(
model_id=Literal(model_id),
obj_name=Literal(mat[""object""]),
material=Literal(mat[""material""])
) for mat in materials
)

return SQL(""INSERT INTO materials(model_id, object, material)VALUES {values}"").format(values=data)

And after the inspection, PyCharm shows the warning '(' expected, got '{'. It's valid from SQL standpoint, but not useful here, as this text in curly braces is just a format placeholder.
Using Alt-Enter to show suggestion offers just ""Change SQL dialect"" feature.
I can disable SQL syntax inspection in general, but I don't want to do that, as in other places it's pretty useful. I tried to find an appropriate disable comment command, but didn't find the list for the built-in SQL.
Is there some way to disable SQL validation for a particular statement, as I really like to keep my code with all green inspections result?

How do I move my mouse in selenium IDE? E.g. a command moving the mouse pointer 14 pixels to the left.
"	"
Selenium IDE is a record and play application. It wasn't design to allow people performing other complex things, just record and play (and manage locators that can change).
If you want to do more complex things, you can try to use Selenium with an OOP language (java, c#, ruby, python etc).

I have removed the telemetry consent but the window with the telescope on which ""your project is currently empty"" is still there.
How can I disable it?
Is there any package which removes it?
"	"
The panel with the telescope and the phrase ""Your project is currently empty"" is shown not by Atom itself, but by a package ""tree-view"". This issue is supposed to be fixed in version ""v0.229.0"" of the package. Meanwhile, you can just disable the package to get rid of the panel:

Open preferences: Edit > Preferences (Linux), Atom > Preferences (macOS), or File > Settings (Windows).
Select ""Packages"".
Search for ""tree-view""
Click ""Disable""

............................................................
You can collapse the whole tree-view panel by: hover you cursor over the inner edge of the panel and a semi-circle with left arrow will appear in the middle; click that.
If you just want a blank tree-view panel instead (hide the graphic & buttons), you can add this to your stylesheet:
#add-projects-view {
display: none !important;
}

IDEA: javac: source release 1.7 requires target release 1.7

How to specify Java version in Spring/Spring Boot pom.xml?

(4 answers)


Closed last year.





I'm working on a SpringBoot application with Java 11 that is built using Maven.
IntelliJ imports the project without any problems, but it shows me an error that for using eg. Map.of(""A"", ""B"") methods I need to raise the language level. Apparently IntelliJ doesn't detect the java version correctly that I'm using.
In my pom.xml I'm using the spring-boot-maven-plugin to build
<build>
<plugins>
<plugin>
<groupId>org.springframework.boot</groupId>
<artifactId>spring-boot-maven-plugin</artifactId>
</plugin>
</plugins>
</build>

Other answers on SO (eg. IDEA: javac: source release 1.7 requires target release 1.7) tell me to set the ""release"" (or source/target) property for the maven-build-plugin but that is incompatible with the spring-boot-maven-plugin (ie. causes problems with dependencies etc.).
How can I make IntelliJ automatically recognize and set the Java language level to 11 without manually having to change it after every pom.xml reimport?
"	"
By default IntelliJ (as of 2020.3) assumes Java language level 8 if not otherwise specified.
The spring-boot-maven-plugin respects the
<properties>
<java.version>11</java.version>
</properties>

setting and adjusts the maven-compiler-plugin properties (release, source, target) accordingly, that are respected by IntelliJ for setting the Java language level on the project.
Just add this property to the pom.xml and reload the the project (not refresh, that didn't work for me).
See also How to specify Java 11 version in Spring/Spring Boot pom.xml? for a more detailed explanation on how this works behind the scenes.

Use the following xpath which will select the tr based on anchor text and then find the input checkbox.
//tr[.//a[text()='1024.0281']]//input[@class='RightText']

Or use preceding
//a[text()='1024.0281']/preceding::input[@name='DHR'][1]

I am confused as to how to get into script mode in Python's standard IDLE. I surprisingly cannot find how to get into it on Google.
"	"
I believe you mean the simple editor that ships with Python, ""IDLE""?
If you have an IDLE console window open already, go to file->New File, or press ctrl+N to get a window where you can write and save a python file like a text editor.
When you've written a script in that editor you can save it as you'd expect from File->Save and run it from Run->Run Module, or press F5 as a quick shortcut. It should then output any text to the IDLE console window.
Also see the comments directly beneath your question for some resources :) Happy scripting!

I couldn't find the solution to the problem so I solved it in an alternative but less safe way.
I used the tab advance to position myself over the field, which activates the code that enables it and allows access to it.
Since it is a very risky solution, since it is easy for the order of the fields to be changed frequently, if someone knows the solution to the original problem, I would be very grateful.

Is there way, in Atom, to open files that are mentioned in comments?
When I edit a code file, there are often other code files of interest that I may want to also open while working on that file. Sometimes these reference files are miles away and require numerous steps of navigation to open them via the left-pane tree structure.
I was thinking, it would be nice if I could put relative file paths into javascript comments in a manner that atom would understand that if I click that path it should open that file in a new tab.
I suspect this isn't an original idea, so I'm hoping someone can direct me to a solution that enables this type of functionality or make me aware of how it is already enabled but I must use some syntax I'm not currently using.
"	"
I found open-project-file and it seems like a nice fit.
Update: I tested it and it works great! You just click on the relative path (whether it is located in code or comment) and by hitting ctrl-shift-o it immediately opens the file in a new tab within the atom editor.

I am quite new to Java and I am struggeling to understand Exceptions.
In an Excercise I was supposed to implement the Interface ""exceptions.excercise.Validator"" in the class ""ValidatorImpl"" and the Method ""User#validate"".
I am struggeling to understand what exactly is happening in these lines of codes and I would really appreciate it, if somebody could help me :):

I am not sure if you need the whole java project to understand the code but here's what I don't really understand:
*In User.java

public void validate() throws UserException {
Validator valid = new ValidatorImpl();

try {
valid.validateAge(this.getAge());
valid.validateEmailWithRuntimeException(this.getEmail());
} catch (ValidationException e) {
throw new UserException(""age is incorrect"", e);
} catch(ValidationRuntimeException e ) {
throw new UserException(""mail is incorrect"", e);
}
}


In ValidatorImpl.java:
package exceptions.excercise;

public class ValidatorImpl implements Validator {

@Override
public void validateAge(int age) throws ValidationException {

if ((age < 0) || (age > 120)) {
throw new ValidationException(age + ""not betweeon 0 and 120"");
}
}

@Override
public void validateEmailWithRuntimeException(String email) {

if (email == null) {
throw new ValidationRuntimeException(""email is null"");
}
if (!email.contains(""@"")) {
throw new ValidationRuntimeException(""email must contain @sign"");
}
}


}

I know this is quite a lot.
Thank you if you read all of this :)
"	"
First, you have a try-catch block. This will catch exceptions thrown in the try-part and if an exception is found they'll run the catch-block for the type of exception. The methods valid.validateAge(int) and valid.validateEmailWithRuntimeException(String) both can throw exceptions.
If the age is under 0 or over 120 validateAge will throw an ValidationException. The try-catch will catch that and will run the first catch-block, which will output a new UserExeption(""age is incorrect"").
If the age is valid, validateEmailWithRuntimeException will be called next.
This works the same way! If the Email is invalid, a ValidationRuntimeException will be thrown and catched. In this case, the second catch-block will be called and a new UserExeption(""mail is incorrect"") will be outputted.

What does ArrayIndexOutOfBoundsException mean and how do I get rid of it? 

Here is a code sample that triggers the exception:

String[] names = { ""tom"", ""bob"", ""harry"" };
for (int i = 0; i <= names.length; i++) {
System.out.println(names[i]);
}

"	"
Your first port of call should be the documentation which explains it reasonably clearly:


Thrown to indicate that an array has been accessed with an illegal index. The index is either negative or greater than or equal to the size of the array.


So for example:

int[] array = new int[5];
int boom = array[10]; // Throws the exception


As for how to avoid it... um, don't do that. Be careful with your array indexes.

One problem people sometimes run into is thinking that arrays are 1-indexed, e.g.

int[] array = new int[5];
// ... populate the array here ...
for (int index = 1; index <= array.length; index++)
{
System.out.println(array[index]);
}


That will miss out the first element (index 0) and throw an exception when index is 5. The valid indexes here are 0-4 inclusive. The correct, idiomatic for statement here would be:

for (int index = 0; index < array.length; index++)


(That's assuming you need the index, of course. If you can use the enhanced for loop instead, do so.)
............................................................
if (index < 0 || index >= array.length) {
// Don't use this index. This is out of bounds (borders, limits, whatever).
} else {
// Yes, you can safely use this index. The index is present in the array.
Object element = array[index];
}


See also:


The Java Tutorials - Language Basics - Arrays




Update: as per your code snippet, 

for (int i = 0; i<=name.length; i++) {


The index is inclusive the array's length. This is out of bounds. You need to replace <= by <.

for (int i = 0; i < name.length; i++) {

............................................................
From this excellent article: ArrayIndexOutOfBoundsException in for loop

To put it briefly:

In the last iteration of

for (int i = 0; i <= name.length; i++) {


i will equal name.length which is an illegal index, since array indices are zero-based.

Your code should read

for (int i = 0; i < name.length; i++) 
^

............................................................
It means that you are trying to access an index of an array which is not valid as it is not in between the bounds.

For example this would initialize a primitive integer array with the upper bound 4.

int intArray[] = new int[5];


Programmers count from zero. So this for example would throw an ArrayIndexOutOfBoundsException as the upper bound is 4 and not 5.

intArray[5];

............................................................
What causes ArrayIndexOutOfBoundsException?

If you think of a variable as a ""box"" where you can place a value, then an array is a series of boxes placed next to eachother, where the number of boxes is a finite and explicit integer.

Creating an array like this:

final int[] myArray = new int[5]


creates a row of 5 boxes, each holding an int. Each of the boxes have an index, a position in the series of boxes. This index starts at 0, and ends at N-1, where N is the size of the array (the number of boxes).

To retrieve one of the values from this series of boxes, you can refer to it through its index, like this:

myArray[3]


Which will give you the value of the 4th box in the series (since the first box has index 0).

An ArrayIndexOutOfBoundsException is caused by trying to retrive a ""box"" that does not exist, by passing an index that is higher than the index of last ""box"", or negative.

With my running example, these code snippets would produce such an exception:

myArray[5] //tries to retrieve the 6th ""box"" when there is only 5
myArray[-1] //just makes no sense
myArray[1337] //waay to high


How to avoid ArrayIndexOutOfBoundsException

In order to prevent ArrayIndexOutOfBoundsException, there are some key points to consider:

Looping

When looping through an array, always make sure that the index you are retrieving is strictly smaller than the length of the array (the number of boxes). For instance:

for (int i = 0; i < myArray.length; i++) {


Notice the <, never mix a = in there..

You might want to be tempted to do something like this:

for (int i = 1; i <= myArray.length; i++) {
final int someint = myArray[i - 1]


Just don't. Stick to the one above (if you need to use the index) and it will save you a lot of pain.

Where possible, use foreach:

for (int value : myArray) {


This way you won't have to think about indexes at all.

When looping, whatever you do, NEVER change the value of the loop iterator (here: i). The only place this should change value is to keep the loop going. Changing it otherwise is just risking an exception, and is in most cases not neccessary.

Retrieval/update

When retrieving an arbitrary element of the array, always check that it is a valid index against the length of the array:

public Integer getArrayElement(final int index) {
if (index < 0 || index >= myArray.length) {
return null; //although I would much prefer an actual exception being thrown when this happens.
}
return myArray[index];
}

............................................................
To avoid an array index out-of-bounds exception, one should use the enhanced-for statement where and when they can.

The primary motivation (and use case) is when you are iterating and you do not require any complicated iteration steps.You would not be able to use an enhanced-for to move backwards in an array or only iterate on every other element.

You're guaranteed not to run out of elements to iterate over when doing this, and your [corrected] example is easily converted over.

The code below:

String[] name = {""tom"", ""dick"", ""harry""};
for(int i = 0; i< name.length; i++) {
System.out.print(name[i] + ""\n"");
}


...is equivalent to this:

String[] name = {""tom"", ""dick"", ""harry""};
for(String firstName : name) {
System.out.println(firstName + ""\n"");
}

............................................................
In your code you have accessed the elements from index 0 to the length of the string array. name.length gives the number of string objects in your array of string objects i.e. 3, but you can access only up to index 2 name[2],
because the array can be accessed from index 0 to name.length - 1 where you get name.length number of objects.
Even while using a for loop you have started with index zero and you should end with name.length - 1. In an array a[n] you can access form a[0] to a[n-1].
For example:
String[] a={""str1"", ""str2"", ""str3"" ..., ""strn""};

for(int i=0; i<a.length(); i++)
System.out.println(a[i]);

In your case:
String[] name = {""tom"", ""dick"", ""harry""};

for(int i = 0; i<=name.length; i++) {
System.out.print(name[i] +'\n');
}

............................................................
For your given array the length of the array is 3(i.e. name.length = 3). But as it stores element starting from index 0, it has max index 2.

So, instead of'i**<=name.length' you should write 'i<**name.length' to avoid 'ArrayIndexOutOfBoundsException'.
............................................................
So much for this simple question, but I just wanted to highlight a new feature in Java which will avoid all confusions around indexing in arrays even for beginners. Java-8 has abstracted the task of iterating for you.

int[] array = new int[5];

//If you need just the items
Arrays.stream(array).forEach(item -> { println(item); });

//If you need the index as well
IntStream.range(0, array.length).forEach(index -> { println(array[index]); })


What's the benefit? Well, one thing is the readability like English. Second, you need not worry about the ArrayIndexOutOfBoundsException
............................................................
The most common case I've seen for seemingly mysterious ArrayIndexOutOfBoundsExceptions, i.e. apparently not caused by your own array handling code, is the concurrent use of SimpleDateFormat. Particularly in a servlet or controller:

public class MyController {
SimpleDateFormat dateFormat = new SimpleDateFormat(""MM/dd/yyyy"");

public void handleRequest(ServletRequest req, ServletResponse res) {
Date date = dateFormat.parse(req.getParameter(""date""));
}
}


If two threads enter the SimplateDateFormat.parse() method together you will likely see an ArrayIndexOutOfBoundsException. Note the synchronization section of the class javadoc for SimpleDateFormat.

Make sure there is no place in your code that are accessing thread unsafe classes like SimpleDateFormat in a concurrent manner like in a servlet or controller. Check all instance variables of your servlets and controllers for likely suspects.
............................................................
You are getting ArrayIndexOutOfBoundsException due to i<=name.length part. name.length return the length of the string name, which is 3. Hence when you try to access name[3], it's illegal and throws an exception.

Resolved code:

String[] name = {""tom"", ""dick"", ""harry""};
for(int i = 0; i < name.length; i++) { //use < insteadof <=
System.out.print(name[i] +'\n');
}


It's defined in the Java language specification:


The public final field length, which contains the number of components
of the array. length may be positive or zero.

............................................................


That's how this type of exception looks when thrown in Eclipse. The number in red signifies the index you tried to access. So the code would look like this:

myArray[5]


The error is thrown when you try to access an index which doesn't exist in that array. If an array has a length of 3,

int[] intArray = new int[3];


then the only valid indexes are:

intArray[0]
intArray[1]
intArray[2]


If an array has a length of 1,

int[] intArray = new int[1];


then the only valid index is:

intArray[0]


Any integer equal to the length of the array, or bigger than it: is out of bounds.

Any integer less than 0: is out of bounds;

P.S.: If you look to have a better understanding of arrays and do some practical exercises, there's a video here: tutorial on arrays in Java
............................................................
For multidimensional arrays, it can be tricky to make sure you access the length property of the right dimension. Take the following code for example:

int [][][] a= new int [2][3][4];

for(int i = 0; i < a.length; i++){
for(int j = 0; j < a[i].length; j++){
for(int k = 0; k < a[j].length; k++){
System.out.print(a[i][j][k]);
}
System.out.println();
}
System.out.println();
}


Each dimension has a different length, so the subtle bug is that the middle and inner loops use the length property of the same dimension (because a[i].length is the same as a[j].length).

Instead, the inner loop should use a[i][j].length (or a[0][0].length, for simplicity).
............................................................
For any array of length n, elements of the array will have an index from 0 to n-1.

If your program is trying to access any element (or memory) having array index greater than n-1, then Java will throw ArrayIndexOutOfBoundsException

So here are two solutions that we can use in a program


Maintaining count:

for(int count = 0; count < array.length; count++) {
System.out.println(array[count]);
}


Or some other looping statement like

int count = 0;
while(count < array.length) {
System.out.println(array[count]);
count++;
}

A better way go with a for each loop, in this method a programmer has no need to bother about the number of elements in the array.

for(String str : array) {
System.out.println(str);
}


............................................................
ArrayIndexOutOfBoundsException whenever this exception is coming it mean you are trying to use an index of array which is out of its bounds or in lay man terms you are requesting more than than you have initialised.

To prevent this always make sure that you are not requesting a index which is not present in array i.e. if array length is 10 then your index must range between 0 to 9
............................................................
ArrayIndexOutOfBounds means you are trying to index a position within an array that is not allocated.

In this case:

String[] name = { ""tom"", ""dick"", ""harry"" };
for (int i = 0; i <= name.length; i++) {
System.out.println(name[i]);
}



name.length is 3 since the array has been defined with 3 String objects.
When accessing the contents of an array, position starts from 0. Since there are 3 items, it would mean name[0]=""tom"", name[1]=""dick"" and name[2]=""harry
When you loop, since i can be less than or equal to name.length, you are trying to access name[3] which is not available.


To get around this... 


In your for loop, you can do i < name.length. This would prevent looping to name[3] and would instead stop at name[2]

for(int i = 0; i<name.length; i++)
Use a for each loop

String[] name = { ""tom"", ""dick"", ""harry"" };
for(String n : name) {
System.out.println(n);
}
Use list.forEach(Consumer action) (requires Java8)

String[] name = { ""tom"", ""dick"", ""harry"" };
Arrays.asList(name).forEach(System.out::println);
Convert array to stream - this is a good option if you want to perform additional 'operations' to your array e.g. filter, transform the text, convert to a map etc (requires Java8)

String[] name = { ""tom"", ""dick"", ""harry"" };
---Arrays.asList(name).stream().forEach(System.out::println);
---Stream.of(name).forEach(System.out::println);

............................................................
ArrayIndexOutOfBoundsException means that you are trying to access an index of the array that does not exist or out of the bound of this array. Array indexes start from 0 and end at length - 1. 

In your case 

for(int i = 0; i<=name.length; i++) {
System.out.print(name[i] +'\n'); // i goes from 0 to length, Not correct
}


ArrayIndexOutOfBoundsException happens when you are trying to access 
the name.length indexed element which does not exist (array index ends atlength -1). just replacing <= with < would solve this problem. 

for(int i = 0; i < name.length; i++) {
System.out.print(name[i] +'\n');// i goes from 0 to length - 1, Correct
}

............................................................
According to your Code :

String[] name = {""tom"", ""dick"", ""harry""};
for(int i = 0; i<=name.length; i++) {
System.out.print(name[i] +'\n');
}


If You check
System.out.print(name.length);

you will get 3;

that mean your name length is 3

your loop is running from 0 to 3 
which should be running either ""0 to 2"" or ""1 to 3""

Answer

String[] name = {""tom"", ""dick"", ""harry""};
for(int i = 0; i<name.length; i++) {
System.out.print(name[i] +'\n');
}

............................................................
Each item in an array is called an element, and each element is accessed by its numerical index. As shown in the preceding illustration, numbering begins with 0. The 9th element, for example, would therefore be accessed at index 8.

IndexOutOfBoundsException is thrown to indicate that an index of some sort (such as to an array, to a string, or to a vector) is out of range.

Any array X, can be accessed from [0 to (X.length - 1)]
............................................................
I see all the answers here explaining how to work with arrays and how to avoid the index out of bounds exceptions.I personally avoid arrays at all costs.I use the Collections classes, which avoids all the silliness of having to deal with array indices entirely.The looping constructs work beautifully with collections supporting code that is both easier to write, understand and maintain.
............................................................
If you use an array's length to control iteration of a for loop, always remember that the index of the first item in an array is 0. So the index of the last element in an array is one less than the array's length.
............................................................
ArrayIndexOutOfBoundsException name itself explains that If you trying to access the value at the index which is out of the scope of Array size then such kind of exception occur. 

In your case, You can just remove equal sign from your for loop.

for(int i = 0; i<name.length; i++)


The better option is to iterate an array: 

for(String i : name )
System.out.println(i);

............................................................
This error is occurs at runs loopoverlimit times.Let's consider simple example like this,

class demo{
public static void main(String a[]){

int[] numberArray={4,8,2,3,89,5};

int i;

for(i=0;i<numberArray.length;i++){
System.out.print(numberArray[i+1]+"""");
}
}


At first, I have initialized an array as 'numberArray'. then , some array elements are printed using for loop. When loop is running 'i' time , print the (numberArray[i+1] element..(when i value is 1, numberArray[i+1] element is printed.)..Suppose that, when i=(numberArray.length-2), last element of array is printed..When 'i' value goes to (numberArray.length-1) , no value for printing..In that point , 'ArrayIndexOutOfBoundsException' is occur.I hope to you could get idea.thank you !
............................................................
You can use Optional in functional style to avoid NullPointerException and ArrayIndexOutOfBoundsException :

String[] array = new String[]{""aaa"", null, ""ccc""};
for (int i = 0; i < 4; i++) {
String result = Optional.ofNullable(array.length > i ? array[i] : null)
.map(x -> x.toUpperCase()) //some operation here
.orElse(""NO_DATA"");
System.out.println(result);
}


Output:

AAA
NO_DATA
CCC
NO_DATA

............................................................
In most of the programming language indexes is start from 0.So you must have to write i<names.length or i<=names.length-1 instead of i<=names.length.
............................................................
You could not iterate or store more data than the length of your array. In this case you could do like this:

for (int i = 0; i <= name.length - 1; i++) {
// ....
}


Or this:

for (int i = 0; i < name.length; i++) {
// ...
}

I recently started using Google Colab and absolutely love the autocomplete UI. I usually code in Jupyter Notebook and hence am used to an autocomplete which only returns the single methods and takes a second or two to load. Google Colab on the other hand is instant, returns the method and also tells you the expected arguments and a description of what a method does. I love it, it reminds me of my old days in eclipse.

Therefore I wanted to ask if there is a module/plugin for Jupyter Notebook to have this UI. Otherwise, is there a different IDE like Jupyter (with these code snippets) with the advanced autocomplete functions? Possibly open source. Thanks.

You can try to use the Hinterland, it's an extension that enable code autocompletion menu for every keypress in a code cell, instead of only calling it with tab.

I can't get monodevelop to work on Manjaro. I tried all the different options to install in AUR (monodevelop-beta, monodevelop-bin, monodevelop-git, monodevelop-nuget3, monodevelop-stable) and most of them failed to build.

The only one that didn't fail was monodevlop-bin, but I couldn't get it to build my program. At first I got this error:

Confirm that the path in the <Import> declaration is correct, and that the file exists on disk. (MSB4019)


There was no folder ""Roslyn"" in the specified location. I made a folder with that name and copied the file Microsoft.CSharp.targets from msbuild/15.0/bin/ in the ""Roslyn"" folder (renamed the copy to Microsoft.CSharp.Core.targets). 

It probably wasn't a good idea, but I tried it, just in case.

That did seemed to work, but then I got another error:

Since the issues with compatibility with the latest version of mono and msbuild as well as 
there no longer being a ""stable"" build mode on the github project I am disowning this project.

Sadly I stopped using this IDE in favor of VSCode a while ago and also no longer have the time to maintain it with the large number of incompatibilities with the various dependencies.

Hopefully someone with more time will take over..


This is from the original maintainter/builder (at the time of writing) in the comments of the AUR page. After him, it seems that another person tried to continue maintaining it, but he still failed:


coder2000 commented on 2020-03-31 18:51 

The build process is currently broken and the documentation is incomplete.


So, for now, you can't use monodevelop on Arch based systems (at least from AUR). You will have to use alternative IDEs, like JetBrains Rider, or text editors (with proper extensions), like VSCode or Atom. 

Also, from personal experience, I would advice against using Arch based distributions for programming, because of problems like that. Use Ubuntu or something Ubuntu based for easiest experience with programming tools (I use Linux Mint for programming and I haven't had any major problems).

I am trying to migrate from IDEs like Eclipse to a standalone Java environment, but I'm having problems tying together multiple files into a project.
Here is some sample code, where both files are in the same directory:
App.java
package com.example.main;

public class App {
public static void main(String[] args) {
Example.test();
}
}

Example.java
package com.example.main;

public class Example {
public static void test() {
System.out.println(""It's working"");
}
}

When running App.java in an IDE, the expected output of It's working is printed, however after executing javac *.java the files seem to ignore eachother.
Here is the error that occurs when executing java App.java after it's been compiled:
App.java:5: error: cannot find symbol
Example.test();
^
symbol: variable Example
location: class App
1 error
error: compilation failed

How can I compile the files in a project so that they recognise eachother?
"	"
If you running Java 11 and above, java App.java will compile App.java only.
If you need to refer Example.java, first you need to compile both java files into a directory.
Let give it named 'classes'. The command will be
javac -d classes *.java
After that, you can run it via
java -cp classes com.example.main.App. Please note that App is without .class suffix
Of course, it is advisable to use build tools like Apache Maven or Gradle to build your project if it grow larger or need other dependencies.

I am a huge fan of Jetbrains ""AppCode"". But due to the variety of projects I have some depending on older XCode versions and others can be the latest and greatest. It's great that we can have multiple XCode installations side-by-side. But is this also possible with AppCode? I remember that back a couple of years, the EAP version could be installed side-by-side with the stable release. This would also already help, but I cant even find a separate EAP download anymore.

Anybody any tips for me?

You can use JetBrains Toolbox to install as many product versions as you like side by side with the automatic update (optional) and rollback support.

In Toolbox you can set certain product versions to stick to the specific installed version and do not offer the updates.

Major IDE versions do not share the configuration and can be even run at the same time. Minor version can be also configured to use different folders for config/plugins/caches if needed.

How do people getting into scala and using it for big projects handle unreliability of tools/IDE? Do you just accept red markings all over your source code?

I encounter yet another scala codebase where working code is flagged red by idea Cannot resolve symbol Repr.

I start a playground project to explore one of libraries in the codebase - shapeless (as I understand it a highly regarded library in scala community).

I write extremely basic code from the first page of official shapeless guide.

package example
import shapeless._

val genericEmployee = Generic[Employee].to(Employee(""Dave"", isOld = true))
val genericIceCream = Generic[IceCream].to(IceCream(""yellow"", isInCone = false))

There seems to be a fundamental difficulty in IntelliJ supporting libraries relying on macros such as shapeless

@niktrop


Shapeless is heavily using macros. We have no way to support them
generically.


@joroKr21 


there is a fundamental barrier for whitebox macros. You have to run a
complete typecheck and expand them just to see what type they return
and this is not feasible to do on every keystroke. Blackbox macros on
the other hand shouldn't pose such problems.


@olafurpg 


scala-compiler and intellij-scala are different typecheckers,
scala-reflect macros are currently implemented against scala-compiler
APIs which makes them difficult to support in alternative scala
compilers.

"	"
You have to add it manually and this depends of your database, you have two ways:


If you are using maven or gradle, then add the dependency in the pom.xml or build.gradle 
If you are use the old way(which is not recommended) then add the jdbc jar in the lib folder.

In PhpStorm, when I type li and press tab, it auto-completes with <link rel=""stylesheet"" href="""" > I want it to auto-complete with <li></li> instead.

However, looking at the settings, this is what it should already be doing...

in the ""Live Template"" settings, it looks like this:



So according to these settings, li should autocomplete to <li>...</li>, and link should auto complete to <link rel=""stylesheet"" href=""..."">. Which would be great. But the li live template never works, it seems to be giving priority to the link live template.

How can I get the li live template to work, without disabling the link live templates?

Update:

Here's a gif of what happens in a blank ""blade"" scratch:



I also discovered that this only happens in Laravel blade files. When I tried it in an HTML scratch note, it works (a li element was auto-completed)

If I disable the live templates in zen-html for ""link"", then it also works (but I'd rather not disable them)

Other details: 


PhpStorm 2019.3.4
66 ""bundled"" plugins (I haven't changed these from default settings)
downloaded plugins: .env files support, BrowseWordAtCaret, Laravel, Solarized Themes

"	"
As per your gif the code completion popup has different Live Template entry selected when you hit Tab.

If you close the completion popup before that (with Esc) it will expand into <li></li> as expected.



In any case, this looks related: https://youtrack.jetbrains.com/issue/WI-50106. Ticket says it's fixed for next major version (2020.1)

Please try 2020.1 Beta / EAP build to see if this will work for you: https://www.jetbrains.com/phpstorm/nextversion/

I am using a custom script to format my code. Currently, whenever I want to format, I have to call Tasks: Run Task and then choose my format task.

Is it possible to tell Format Document to execute my tasks?

This would be nice because it would allow me to do automatic formation on save.

I haven't tested it with an actual formatter but you can call tasks from keybindings.try

{
""key"": ""shift+alt+f"",
""command"": ""-editor.action.formatDocument"",
""when"": ""editorHasDocumentFormattingProvider && editorHasDocumentFormattingProvider && editorTextFocus && !editorReadonly""
},

{
""key"": ""shift+alt+f"", // or whatever keybinding you wish
""command"": ""workbench.action.tasks.runTask"",
""args"": ""your format task label here""
},


I used the default Format Document keybinding but you could use whatever keybinding you wish.

I've only been using Filezilla over the past few years to upload simple landing page templates to my hosting company. I've now created a new Django project on Google Cloud Platform that comes with pre-installed LAMP (P for python) Package, so far neither aCpanel nor FTP credentials have been mentioned anywhere, only SSH, which confused me very much. 

But, I quickly figured that I would need an IDE to start building a web application.There are many options including local IDEs (Vcode, Pycharm, Eclipse) and Cloud IDEs (Replit, Cloud9). I decided to go with C9 as it offers a GCP integration and it's free.

AWS Cloud9, a cloud-based IDE lets you write, run, and debug your code with just a browser, you donâ€™t need to install files or configure any development machine to start new projects.

So, is there any reason to use a SFTP to transfer or upload files?

Is it possible to install flutter on VS 2019 IDE (not Visual Studio Code or Android Studio/IntelliJ)?

I can't find anything for VS 2019, but only for VS Code.
"	"
From the Flutter FAQ:

Does Flutter work with any editors or IDEs?
We support plugins for Android Studio, IntelliJ IDEA, and VS Code.
See editor configuration for setup details, and Android Studio/IntelliJ and VS Code for tips on how to use the plugins.
Alternatively, you can use a combination of the flutter command in a terminal and one of the many editors that support editing Dart.

So, no
You cannot get the same tooling in Visual Studio that you can get in Android Studio/IntelliJ and VS Code because the Flutter team does not work on support for any other IDEs.
If you visit IDEs and editors for Dart, you can see what code editors have support for editing Dart code and you can use that in conjunction with the flutter command to get a similar experience.

Questions:


What are raw types in Java, and why do I often hear that they shouldn't be used in new code?
What is the alternative if we can't use raw types, and how is it better?

"	"
What is a raw type?
The Java Language Specification defines a raw type as follows:
JLS 4.8 Raw Types

A raw type is defined to be one of:

The reference type that is formed by taking the name of a generic type declaration without an accompanying type argument list.

An array type whose element type is a raw type.

A non-static member type of a raw type R that is not inherited from a superclass or superinterface of R.



Here's an example to illustrate:
public class MyType<E> {
class Inner { }
static class Nested { }

public static void main(String[] args) {
MyType mt;// warning: MyType is a raw type
MyType.Inner inn; // warning: MyType.Inner is a raw type

MyType.Nested nest; // no warning: not parameterized type
MyType<Object> mt1; // no warning: type parameter given
MyType<?> mt2;// no warning: type parameter given (wildcard OK!)
}
}

Here, MyType<E> is a parameterized type (JLS 4.5). It is common to colloquially refer to this type as simply MyType for short, but technically the name is MyType<E>.
mt has a raw type (and generates a compilation warning) by the first bullet point in the above definition; inn also has a raw type by the third bullet point.
MyType.Nested is not a parameterized type, even though it's a member type of a parameterized type MyType<E>, because it's static.
mt1, and mt2 are both declared with actual type parameters, so they're not raw types.

What's so special about raw types?
Essentially, raw types behaves just like they were before generics were introduced. That is, the following is entirely legal at compile-time.
List names = new ArrayList(); // warning: raw type!
names.add(""John"");
names.add(""Mary"");
names.add(Boolean.FALSE); // not a compilation error!

The above code runs just fine, but suppose you also have the following:
for (Object o : names) {
String name = (String) o;
System.out.println(name);
} // throws ClassCastException!
//java.lang.Boolean cannot be cast to java.lang.String

Now we run into trouble at run-time, because names contains something that isn't an instanceof String.
Presumably, if you want names to contain only String, you could perhaps still use a raw type and manually check every add yourself, and then manually cast to String every item from names. Even better, though is NOT to use a raw type and let the compiler do all the work for you, harnessing the power of Java generics.
List<String> names = new ArrayList<String>();
names.add(""John"");
names.add(""Mary"");
names.add(Boolean.FALSE); // compilation error!

Of course, if you DO want names to allow a Boolean, then you can declare it as List<Object> names, and the above code would compile.

How's a raw type different from using <Object> as type parameters?
The following is a quote from Effective Java 2nd Edition, Item 23: Don't use raw types in new code:

Just what is the difference between the raw type List and the parameterized type List<Object>? Loosely speaking, the former has opted out generic type checking, while the latter explicitly told the compiler that it is capable of holding objects of any type. While you can pass a List<String> to a parameter of type List, you can't pass it to a parameter of type List<Object>. There are subtyping rules for generics, and List<String> is a subtype of the raw type List, but not of the parameterized type List<Object>. As a consequence, you lose type safety if you use raw type like List, but not if you use a parameterized type like List<Object>.

To illustrate the point, consider the following method which takes a List<Object> and appends a new Object().
void appendNewObject(List<Object> list) {
 list.add(new Object());
}

Generics in Java are invariant. A List<String> is not a List<Object>, so the following would generate a compiler warning:
List<String> names = new ArrayList<String>();
appendNewObject(names); // compilation error!

If you had declared appendNewObject to take a raw type List as parameter, then this would compile, and you'd therefore lose the type safety that you get from generics.

What is the difference between <E extends Number> and <Number>?
java generics (not) covariance


How's a raw type different from using <?> as a type parameter?
List<Object>, List<String>, etc are all List<?>, so it may be tempting to just say that they're just List instead. However, there is a major difference: since a List<E> defines only add(E), you can't add just any arbitrary object to a List<?>. On the other hand, since the raw type List does not have type safety, you can add just about anything to a List.
Consider the following variation of the previous snippet:
static void appendNewObject(List<?> list) {
list.add(new Object()); // compilation error!
}
//...

List<String> names = new ArrayList<String>();
appendNewObject(names); // this part is fine!

The compiler did a wonderful job of protecting you from potentially violating the type invariance of the List<?>! If you had declared the parameter as the raw type List list, then the code would compile, and you'd violate the type invariant of List<String> names.

A raw type is the erasure of that type
Back to JLS 4.8:

It is possible to use as a type the erasure of a parameterized type or the erasure of an array type whose element type is a parameterized type. Such a type is called a raw type.
[...]
The superclasses (respectively, superinterfaces) of a raw type are the erasures of the superclasses (superinterfaces) of any of the parameterizations of the generic type.
The type of a constructor, instance method, or non-static field of a raw type C that is not inherited from its superclasses or superinterfaces is the raw type that corresponds to the erasure of its type in the generic declaration corresponding to C.

In simpler terms, when a raw type is used, the constructors, instance methods and non-static fields are also erased.
Take the following example:
class MyType<E> {
List<String> getNames() {
return Arrays.asList(""John"", ""Mary"");
}

public static void main(String[] args) {
MyType rawType = new MyType();
// unchecked warning!
// required: List<String> found: List
List<String> names = rawType.getNames();
// compilation error!
// incompatible types: Object cannot be converted to String
for (String str : rawType.getNames())
System.out.print(str);
}
}

When we use the raw MyType, getNames becomes erased as well, so that it returns a raw List!
JLS 4.6 continues to explain the following:

Type erasure also maps the signature of a constructor or method to a signature that has no parameterized types or type variables. The erasure of a constructor or method signature s is a signature consisting of the same name as s and the erasures of all the formal parameter types given in s.
The return type of a method and the type parameters of a generic method or constructor also undergo erasure if the method or constructor's signature is erased.
The erasure of the signature of a generic method has no type parameters.

The following bug report contains some thoughts from Maurizio Cimadamore, a compiler dev, and Alex Buckley, one of the authors of the JLS, on why this sort of behavior ought to occur: https://bugs.openjdk.java.net/browse/JDK-6400189. (In short, it makes the specification simpler.)

If it's unsafe, why is it allowed to use a raw type?
Here's another quote from JLS 4.8:

The use of raw types is allowed only as a concession to compatibility of legacy code. The use of raw types in code written after the introduction of genericity into the Java programming language is strongly discouraged. It is possible that future versions of the Java programming language will disallow the use of raw types.

Effective Java 2nd Edition also has this to add:

Given that you shouldn't use raw types, why did the language designers allow them? To provide compatibility.
The Java platform was about to enter its second decade when generics were introduced, and there was an enormous amount of Java code in existence that did not use generics. It was deemed critical that all this code remains legal and interoperable with new code that does use generics. It had to be legal to pass instances of parameterized types to methods that were designed for use with ordinary types, and vice versa. This requirement, known as migration compatibility, drove the decision to support raw types.

In summary, raw types should NEVER be used in new code. You should always use parameterized types.

Are there no exceptions?
Unfortunately, because Java generics are non-reified, there are two exceptions where raw types must be used in new code:

Class literals, e.g. List.class, not List<String>.class
instanceof operand, e.g. o instanceof Set, not o instanceof Set<String>

............................................................

What are raw types in Java, and why do I often hear that they shouldn't be used in new code?


Raw-types are ancient history of the Java language. In the beginning there were Collections and they held Objects nothing more and nothing less. Every operation on Collections required casts from Object to the desired type.

List aList = new ArrayList();
String s = ""Hello World!"";
aList.add(s);
String c = (String)aList.get(0);


While this worked most of the time, errors did happen

List aNumberList = new ArrayList();
String one = ""1"";//Number one
aNumberList.add(one);
Integer iOne = (Integer)aNumberList.get(0);//Insert ClassCastException here


The old typeless collections could not enforce type-safety so the programmer had to remember what he stored within a collection.
Generics where invented to get around this limitation, the developer would declare the stored type once and the compiler would do it instead.

List<String> aNumberList = new ArrayList<String>();
aNumberList.add(""one"");
Integer iOne = aNumberList.get(0);//Compile time error
String sOne = aNumberList.get(0);//works fine


For Comparison:

// Old style collections now known as raw types
List aList = new ArrayList(); //Could contain anything
// New style collections with Generics
List<String> aList = new ArrayList<String>(); //Contains only Strings


More complex the Compareable interface:

//raw, not type save can compare with Other classes
class MyCompareAble implements CompareAble
{
 int id;
 public int compareTo(Object other)
 {return this.id - ((MyCompareAble)other).id;}
}
//Generic
class MyCompareAble implements CompareAble<MyCompareAble>
{
 int id;
 public int compareTo(MyCompareAble other)
 {return this.id - other.id;}
}


Note that it is impossible to implement the CompareAble interface with compareTo(MyCompareAble) with raw types.
Why you should not use them:


Any Object stored in a Collection has to be cast before it can be used
Using generics enables compile time checks
Using raw types is the same as storing each value as Object


What the compiler does:
Generics are backward compatible, they use the same java classes as the raw types do. The magic happens mostly at compile time.

List<String> someStrings = new ArrayList<String>();
someStrings.add(""one"");
String one = someStrings.get(0);


Will be compiled as:

List someStrings = new ArrayList();
someStrings.add(""one""); 
String one = (String)someStrings.get(0);


This is the same code you would write if you used the raw types directly. Thought I'm not sure what happens with the CompareAble interface, I guess that it creates two compareTo functions, one taking a MyCompareAble and the other taking an Object and passing it to the first after casting it.

What are the alternatives to raw types: Use generics
............................................................
A raw type is the name of a generic class or interface without any type arguments. For example, given the generic Box class:
public class Box<T> {
public void set(T t) { /* ... */ }
// ...
}

To create a parameterized type of Box<T>, you supply an actual type argument for the formal type parameter T:
Box<Integer> intBox = new Box<>();

If the actual type argument is omitted, you create a raw type of Box<T>:
Box rawBox = new Box();

Therefore, Box is the raw type of the generic type Box<T>. However, a non-generic class or interface type is not a raw type.
Raw types show up in legacy code because lots of API classes (such as the Collections classes) were not generic prior to JDK 5.0. When using raw types, you essentially get pre-generics behavior â€?a Box gives you Objects. For backward compatibility, assigning a parameterized type to its raw type is allowed:
Box<String> stringBox = new Box<>();
Box rawBox = stringBox; // OK

But if you assign a raw type to a parameterized type, you get a warning:
Box rawBox = new Box(); // rawBox is a raw type of Box<T>
Box<Integer> intBox = rawBox; // warning: unchecked conversion

You also get a warning if you use a raw type to invoke generic methods defined in the corresponding generic type:
Box<String> stringBox = new Box<>();
Box rawBox = stringBox;
rawBox.set(8);// warning: unchecked invocation to set(T)

The warning shows that raw types bypass generic type checks, deferring the catch of unsafe code to runtime. Therefore, you should avoid using raw types.
The Type Erasure section has more information on how the Java compiler uses raw types.
Unchecked Error Messages
As mentioned previously, when mixing legacy code with generic code, you may encounter warning messages similar to the following:

Note: Example.java uses unchecked or unsafe operations.
Note: Recompile with -Xlint:unchecked for details.

This can happen when using an older API that operates on raw types, as shown in the following example:
public class WarningDemo {
public static void main(String[] args){
Box<Integer> bi;
bi = createBox();
}

static Box createBox(){
return new Box();
}
}

The term ""unchecked"" means that the compiler does not have enough type information to perform all type checks necessary to ensure type safety. The ""unchecked"" warning is disabled, by default, though the compiler gives a hint. To see all ""unchecked"" warnings, recompile with -Xlint:unchecked.
Recompiling the previous example with -Xlint:unchecked reveals the following additional information:
WarningDemo.java:4: warning: [unchecked] unchecked conversion
found : Box
required: Box<java.lang.Integer>
bi = createBox();
^
1 warning

To completely disable unchecked warnings, use the -Xlint:-unchecked flag. The @SuppressWarnings(""unchecked"") annotation suppresses unchecked warnings. If you are unfamiliar with the @SuppressWarnings syntax, see Annotations.
Original source: Java Tutorials
............................................................
A ""raw"" type in Java is a class which is non-generic and deals with ""raw"" Objects, rather than type-safe generic type parameters.

For example, before Java generics was available, you would use a collection class like this:

LinkedList list = new LinkedList();
list.add(new MyObject());
MyObject myObject = (MyObject)list.get(0);


When you add your object to the list, it doesn't care what type of object it is, and when you get it from the list, you have to explicitly cast it to the type you are expecting.

Using generics, you remove the ""unknown"" factor, because you must explicitly specify which type of objects can go in the list:

LinkedList<MyObject> list = new LinkedList<MyObject>();
list.add(new MyObject());
MyObject myObject = list.get(0);


Notice that with generics you don't have to cast the object coming from the get call, the collection is pre-defined to only work with MyObject.This very fact is the main driving factor for generics.It changes a source of runtime errors into something that can be checked at compile time.
............................................................
 private static List<String> list = new ArrayList<String>();


You should specify the type-parameter. 

The warning advises that types that are defined to support generics should be parameterized, rather than using their raw form.

List is defined to support generics: public class List<E>. This allows many type-safe operations, that are checked compile-time.
............................................................
What is a raw type and why do I often hear that they shouldn't be used in new code?

A ""raw type"" is the use of a generic class without specifying a type argument(s) for its parameterized type(s), e.g. using List instead of List<String>. When generics were introduced into Java, several classes were updated to use generics.Using these class as a ""raw type"" (without specifying a type argument) allowed legacy code to still compile.

""Raw types"" are used for backwards compatibility. Their use in new code is not recommended because using the generic class with a type argument allows for stronger typing, which in turn may improve code understandability and lead to catching potential problems earlier.

What is the alternative if we can't use raw types, and how is it better?

The preferred alternative is to use generic classes as intended - with a suitable type argument (e.g. List<String>). This allows the programmer to specify types more specifically, conveys more meaning to future maintainers about the intended use of a variable or data structure, and it allows compiler to enforce better type-safety.These advantages together may improve code quality and help prevent the introduction of some coding errors.

For example, for a method where the programmer wants to ensure a List variable called 'names' contains only Strings:

List<String> names = new ArrayList<String>();
names.add(""John"");// OK
names.add(new Integer(1));// compile error

............................................................
Here I am Considering multiple casesthrough which you can clearifythe concept

1. ArrayList<String> arr = new ArrayList<String>();
2. ArrayList<String> arr = new ArrayList();
3. ArrayList arr = new ArrayList<String>();


Case 1

ArrayList<String> arr it is a ArrayList reference variable with type String which reference to a ArralyList Object of Type String. It means it can hold only String type Object.

It is a Strict to String nota Raw Type so, It will never raise an warning .

arr.add(""hello"");// alone statement will compile successfully and no warning.

arr.add(23);//prone to compile time error.
 //error: no suitable method found for add(int)


Case 2

In this case ArrayList<String> arr is a strict type but your Object new ArrayList(); is a raw type. 

arr.add(""hello""); //alone this compile but raise the warning.
arr.add(23);//again prone to compile time error.
//error: no suitable method found for add(int)


here arr is a Strict type. So, It will raise compile time error when adding a integer.


Warning :- A Raw Type Object is referenced to a Strict type Referenced Variable of ArrayList.


Case 3

In this case ArrayList arr is a raw type but your Object new ArrayList<String>(); is a Strict type. 

arr.add(""hello"");
arr.add(23);//compiles fine but raise the warning.


It will add any type of Object into it because arr is a Raw Type.


Warning :- A Strict Type Object is referenced to a raw type referenced Variable.

............................................................
The compiler wants you to write this:

private static List<String> list = new ArrayList<String>();


because otherwise, you could add any type you like into list, making the instantiation as new ArrayList<String>() pointless. Java generics are a compile-time feature only, so an object created with new ArrayList<String>() will happily accept Integer or JFrame elements if assigned to a reference of the ""raw type"" List - the object itself knows nothing about what types it's supposed to contain, only the compiler does.
............................................................
Here's another case where raw types will bite you:
public class StrangeClass<T> {
@SuppressWarnings(""unchecked"")
public <X> X getSomethingElse() {
return (X)""Testing something else!"";
}

public static void main(String[] args) {
final StrangeClass<String> withGeneric= new StrangeClass<>();
final StrangeClass withoutGeneric = new StrangeClass();
final String value1,
 value2;

// Compiles
value1 = withGeneric.getSomethingElse();

// Produces compile error:
// incompatible types: java.lang.Object cannot be converted to java.lang.String
value2 = withoutGeneric.getSomethingElse();
}
}

This is counter-intuitive because you'd expect the raw type to only affect methods bound to the class type parameter, but it actually also affects generic methods with their own type parameters.
As was mentioned in the accepted answer, you lose all support for generics within the code of the raw type. Every type parameter is converted to its erasure (which in the above example is just Object).
............................................................
A raw-type is the a lack of a type parameter when using a generic type.

Raw-type should not be used because it could cause runtime errors, like inserting a double into what was supposed to be a Set of ints.

Set set = new HashSet();
set.add(3.45); //ok


When retrieving the stuff from the Set, you don't know what is coming out. Let's assume that you expect it to be all ints, you are casting it to Integer; exception at runtime when the double 3.45 comes along.

With a type parameter added to your Set, you will get a compile error at once. This preemptive error lets you fix the problem before something blows up during runtime (thus saving on time and effort).

Set<Integer> set = new HashSet<Integer>();
set.add(3.45); //NOT ok.

............................................................
Avoid raw types.
Raw types refer to using a generic type without specifying a type parameter.
For example:
A list is a raw type, while List<String> is a parameterized type.
When generics were introduced in JDK 1.5, raw types were retained only to maintain backwards compatibility with older versions of Java.
Although using raw types is still possible, they should be avoided:

They usually require casts.
They aren't type safe, and some important kinds of errors will only appear at runtime.
They are less expressive, and don't self-document in the same way as parameterized types..

Example:
import java.util.*;
public final class AvoidRawTypes {
void withRawType() {
//Raw List doesn't self-document, 
//doesn't state explicitly what it can contain
List stars = Arrays.asList(""Arcturus"", ""Vega"", ""Altair"");
Iterator iter = stars.iterator();
while (iter.hasNext()) {
String star = (String) iter.next(); //cast needed
log(star);
}
}

void withParameterizedType() {
List < String > stars = Arrays.asList(""Spica"", ""Regulus"", ""Antares"");
for (String star: stars) {
log(star);
}
}

private void log(Object message) {
System.out.println(Objects.toString(message));
}
}
 

For reference: https://docs.oracle.com/javase/tutorial/java/generics/rawTypes.html
............................................................
What is saying is that your list is a List of unespecified objects. That is that Java does not know what kind of objects are inside the list. Then when you want to iterate the list you have to cast every element, to be able to access the properties of that element (in this case, String).

In general is a better idea to parametrize the collections, so you don't have conversion problems, you will only be able to add elements of the parametrized type and your editor will offer you the appropiate methods to select.

private static List<String> list = new ArrayList<String>();

............................................................
tutorial page.

A raw type is the name of a generic class or interface without any type arguments. For example, given the generic Box class:

public class Box<T> {
public void set(T t) { /* ... */ }
// ...
}


To create a parameterized type of Box, you supply an actual type argument for the formal type parameter T:

Box<Integer> intBox = new Box<>();


If the actual type argument is omitted, you create a raw type of Box:

Box rawBox = new Box();

Raw types are fine when they express what you want to express.

For example, a deserialisation function might return a List, but it doesn't know the list's element type. So List is the appropriate return type here.

90% of the apps are displaying correctly sharp and clear as it's supposed to be on my uhd laptop screen. My scaling is 150% (as default also) (because of uhd screen in 15.6"" laptop, 100% is too inefficient for my eyes.)

But dev c++ and some old softwares are looking blurry.

there is a fix on windows 10 settings named ""advanced scaling"" that is already enabled. is there any way to fix blurry dev c++ or do you recommend better up to date ide for c++ with compiler?

I changed my IDE Eclipse to IntelliJ and everything is good except one thing.
I use hotswap by adding springboot dependency.

<dependency>
<groupId>org.springframework.boot</groupId>
<artifactId>spring-boot-devtools</artifactId>
<version>1.4.2.RELEASE</version>
</dependency>


But the problem is IntelliJ shows a notification continuously that tells me ""Loaded classes are up to date nothing to reload"". It is really annoying. Please let me know how to turn off that notification. I think the posted picture below will show the problem well.
Thank you so much.

I have recently experienced problems with PyCharm with this build info:

The problem with the emulator is that you cannot type into emulator console when using user input. The python script itself works when you turn off console emulation a run your script in python console instead. But running through emulator would be more comfortable for me as for others. The error you receive is this one:

Zadej pozici: Traceback (most recent call last):
File ""C:/Users/Adam/Desktop/Engeto/python/STUFF/1D_piskvorky/1D_pisk.py"", line 79, in 
piskvorky_1d()
File ""C:/Users/Adam/Desktop/Engeto/python/STUFF/1D_piskvorky/1D_pisk.py"", line 70, in piskvorky_1d
hrac_vstup= int(input(""Zadej pozici: ""))
ValueError: invalid literal for int() with base 10: ''

Which means that python received an empty value for int() I suppose, but when you try to type some characters instead of a number:

ValueError: invalid literal for int() with base 10: 'ssss'

The emulator sees that you type characters instead of numbers. Please let me know if someone came across this problem and what was a solution for you, maybe this could help others with finding a solution.
"	"
Your claim that you cannot type into the emulated console is incorrect.You entered strings that are not valid arguments for input.The error messages are correct.They are the same as when one enters the same directly into interactive python.

They are also the same as when one runs the same code from a file.input returns a string.Reread the part of the int doc about string arguments.

If x is not a number or if base is given, then x must be a string,
bytes, or bytearray instance representing an integer literal in the
given base.The literal can be preceded by '+' or '-' and be surrounded
by whitespace.The base defaults to 10.Valid bases are 0 and 2-36.
Base 0 means to interpret the base from the string as an integer literal.

Neither '' nor 'ssss' represent string literals in base 10.

Deleting the .metadata folder in your workspace folder would reset its state. So you may be able to get it to a working state.

Issue : In my IDE the 'Remove widget' option is missing. Check the image below for reference. With my fresh installation of Android Studio in two different computers, the option was never there since the beginning. I'm sure I never played or messed related configurations.

I want to create a single executable from my Python project.A user should be able to download and run it without needing Python installed.If I were just distributing a package, I could use pip, wheel, and PyPI to build and distribute it, but this requires that the user has Python and knows how to install packages.What can I use to build a self-contained executable from a Python project?
"	"
There are several different ways of doing this.

The first -- and likely most common -- way is to use ""freeze"" style programs. These programs work by bundling together Python and your program, essentially combining them into a single executable:

PyInstaller:
Website || Repo || PyPi
Supports Python 3.7 - 3.10 on Windows, Mac, and Linux.

cx_Freeze:
Website || Repo || PyPi
Supports Python 3.6 - 3.10 on Windows, Mac, and Linux.

py2exe:
Website || Repo || PyPi
Supports Python 3.7 - 3.10 on Windows only.

py2app:
Website || Repo || PyPi
Supports Python 3.6 - 3.10 on Macs only.


The main thing to keep in mind is that these types of programs will generally only produce an exe for the operating system you run it in. So for example, running Pyinstaller in Windows will produce a Windows exe, but running Pyinstaller in Linux will produce a Linux exe. If you want to produce an exe for multiple operating systems, you will have to look into using virtual machines or something like Wine.

Of course, that's not the only way of doing things:

pynsist:
Website || Repo || PyPi
Pynsist will create a Windows installer for your program which will directly install Python on the user's computer instead of bundling it with your code and create shortcuts that link to your Python script.
The pynsist tool itself requires Python 3.5+ to run, but supports bundling any version of Python with your program.
Pynsist will create Windows installers only, but can be run from Windows, Mac, and Linux. See their FAQ for more details.

Nuitka:
Website || Repo (Github mirror) || PyPi
Nuitka will literally compile your Python code and produce an exe (as opposed to the other projects, which simply include Python) to try and speed up your code. As a side effect, you'll also get a handy exe you can distribute. Note that you need to have a C++ compiler available on your system.
Supports Python 2.6 - 2.7 and Python 3.3 - 3.10 on Windows, Mac, and Linux.

cython:
Website || Repo || PyPi
Cython is similar to Nuitka in that it is a Python compiler. However, instead of directly compiling your code, it'll compile it to C. You can then take that C code and turn your code into an exe. You'll need to have a C compiler available on your system.
Supports Python 2.7 and Python 3.3 - 3.11 on Windows, Mac, and Linux.



My personal preference is to use PyInstaller since it was the easiest for me to get up and running, was designed to work nicely with various popular libraries such as numpy or pygame, and has great compatibility with various OSes and Python versions.
However, I've also successfully built various exes using cx_Freeze without too much difficulty, so you should also consider trying that program out.
I haven't yet had a chance to to try pynist, Nuitka, or Cython extensively, but they seem like pretty interesting and innovative solutions. If you run into trouble using the first group of programs, it might be worthwhile to try one of these three. Since they work fundamentally differently then the Pyinstaller/cx_freeze-style programs, they might succeed in those odd edge cases where the first group fails.
In particular, I think pynist is a good way of sidestepping the entire issue of distributing your code altogether: Macs and Linux already have native support for Python, and just installing Python on Windows might genuinely be the cleanest solution. (The downside is now that you need to worry about targeting multiple versions of Python + installing libraries).
Nuitka and Cython (in my limited experience) seem to work fairly well. Again, I haven't tested them extensively myself, and so my main observation is that they seem to take much longer to produce an exe then the ""freeze"" style programs do.

All this being said, converting your Python program into an executable isn't necessarily the only way of distributing your code. To learn more about what other options are available, see the following links:

https://packaging.python.org/overview/#packaging-python-applications
https://docs.python-guide.org/shipping/packaging/#for-linux-distributions

............................................................
pyinstaller is under active development as of July 2022. You can see the latest changes on GitHub. It supports for Windows, Linux, and MacOS; 32 and 64-bit. It supports Python versions 2.6, 2.7, and 3.3+.
............................................................
auto-py-to-exe is a GUI for PyInstaller.

Probably a nube question but I have a line of code:
var c = message.substring(i, i + 1);
It works but in the new Google App Script editor, the string property ""substring"" has a double-underline under it, which seems to suggest that it's wrong, but it actually works!
""Show Fixes"" gives me only two options - to ignore the ""error"" or disable checking, neither of which seems like what I want to do. Any ideas?
"	"
I think it is due to how the variable ""message"" is defined. I did a quick test trying to replicate your scenario and this is what I got:
With warning:
var message = 0
message = '123456789'
var c = message.substr(1, 5);

Without warning:
var message = '0'
message = '123456789'
var c = message.substr(1, 5);

Both cases have the same result without errors. If you provide more code I can check why the warning is appearing.
edit:
As you have said in the comments, your variable is being defined from the range of a SpreadSheet using getValue(), this method returns an object with the value of the cell. If you want to obtain a string you should use getDisplayValue(). You can also use the built-in method toString() to make sure that any variable is converted into a string.

A previous question - Visual Studio 2010 element names for theming - has partially answered this, but not what I'm asking, so please don't forward me there.
First, I'm looking for the name of the tooltip background used in the theme editor (Color theme editor for visual studio 2019.)
Secondly, is there a more efficient method of finding these element names? I built this theme mostly by replacing known colors and then for unknowns, screen-shotting, paste to GIMP, get the HEX code search the xml file for the color, find the name, then return to the theme editor with the name and change the color.
The background color to the tooltip as you can see in the following image (outlined in red) is white, making the info generally unreadable. In the menu dialog mentioned in the referenced question, only the foreground color can be changed. The theme editor does not seem to have a field strictly for the tooltip background, so it is likely pulling this background from another unrelated field as visual studio tends to do.

To add to the confusion, in the above image is from a .cs file; on a .cshtml file, the tooltip looks like this. Evidently there are multiple tooltips, as there is also no syntax highlighting in the following example.

I realize this isn't strictly a coding question, but I still believe this to be the most appropriate place to ask the question - If I'm wrong, mods, please direct me to the proper place.

You can tick the checkbox ""Import Maven Projects automatically""

This is less coding and more about my IDE setup. I have this extremely dodgy idea, Spin up a Linux virtual machine running on my windows machine, run Pycharm on windows and set up a remote SSH interpreter on said Linux virtual machine.

Windows subsystem for Linux is an officially supported full Linux virtual machine that runs concurrently with Windows. If you wanted to get fancy with networking or just want your Linux dev environment totally isolated from your computer your could run ubuntu on Docker in your WSL2, which has the added benefit of being a completely even environment every time you want it

I work with Embarcadero Studio 10.2.
To do a debug I'm using break points. Somehow program doesn't stop at those break points any more.
The points are just marked with green tick but do not stop program execution.
In advanced properties of the breakpoint it is marked ""break"".
I tried to look through ""project-options-Delphi Compiler"", everything looks marked ok. I attach the screenshot.
Really appreciate some help! 
"	"
Yup should always reboot your system when trying to clear this problem.
Then, after doing a full build or your project, if the breakpoint hasn't reverted to being displayed red, rather than green, try typing an exclamation mark into the source where the bp is. If the compiler doesn't complain when you next do a compile, that tells you that the compiler is finding a different version of the unit that you think it is.
Btw, the same cause - the compiler finding a different version of the unit that you think it is - can also result in breakpoints being mis-aligned vertically with the source, so that some b.p.s being on blank or irrelevant lines in the source.
Also btw, these sort of problems with breakpoints do not happen in source files which are explicitly listed amongst you project's source files in the Project Manager, because the compiler does not search around for the file.

The icons on the View toolbar no longer work.If I click them they change color but no dialog opens, or the visibility of non-visual components doesn't switch.

This is Delphi 10.4 Update 1. IIRC it did not happen with the update, but later.
I tried dragging it around, hiding it, in combination with 'Save Desktop', reboots, all without success.
Other info:

It also happens in brand new Win32 project (I only do Win32)
OS is Win10
It's not specific to a form/unit
No plugins installed

This is the trick to fix the issue:

Right-click on the toolbar and choose Customize.... Go to the Commands tab
Drag those four icons that don't work from the toolbar into the Commands window.
(They were already there and dragging them off the toolbar did not change anything)
Drag them back from the Commands window onto the toolbar

Do you mean to see the hierarchy of classes and methods in Python files?
You could try to open OUTLINE in VScode. It will show you the classes and methods in the file layer by layer.And it is automatically generated.

I'm new to VSCode and had a question about creating your project folder. This vscode site resource teaches you to create the project via DevCMD.

MS C++ compiler needs specific environment variables set.
There is a batch file (search with Visual Studio Tools in Windows) that creates a CMD.exe terminal and sets the variables. That is DevCMD. It is called Developer Command Prompt for VSxxxx

Yes, Even I had the same problem. For the first time... I think It wont show, restarting the IDE did make that tab appear again.
............................................................
I had this problem too, I deleted all the preference files, such as the AndroidStudioPreview folder & com.google.android.studio.plist, then restarted android studio, it worked.
............................................................
You do not need to restart an IDE. All you need is to close an xml file that does not get a tab and reopen it within an editor. It is a little bug. 
............................................................
Navigate to activity_main.xml tab then Design and Text tab appears.
It doesn't appear in MainActivity.java tab.
You do not need to restart IDE.
............................................................
If text/design tab is missing in new android studio, this can solve by two methods.
You have re-install android studio. And don't forget to delete android studio related all files from temp and local.
Or you can re-install SDK (software development kit) according to your device.

I'm a really big fan of VSCode, But I wanna migrate to vim...
vim has a alternative way, like vscode?
I know multi cursor plugin, But I don't know multi copy and multi paste with orderly.

"	"
There's plug-in mg979/vim-visual-multi, that implements something akin to multiple cursors in Vim.
Without plug-ins, Vim has a feature of Visual Block selection, but that is column based, so when you use it to perform this operation (in the same sequence you used), you end up with this instead:
<div>Multi-copy</div>
<div>Paste </div>
<div>Orderly </div>

(You can later use something else, like a :s, to remove the spaces before the </div>.)
Another option would be to use a Vim macro, to yank the contents of a single line, position the cursor inside one of the <div> blocks and put it there, then position the cursor at the next line, so that the next macro execution will act on the second line, then keep repeating the macro until done.
In Vim, it's actually more natural to do the opposite of what you've done, instead of putting the contents inside the <div>s, putting the <div>s around the contents is much easier. You can use Visual Block insert and append, even Visual Block put will work for the left tag (they have all the same length), there are also common plug-ins (such as vim-surround) to surround a selection in a specific HTML tag, and plug-ins (such as emmet.vim) to quickly generate a structure with a set of HTML tags.
............................................................
Actually you have at least two options on neovim for doing that:
1 - Using (nvim) inccommand like:
:%s/<div>\zs/whetever you want/g

 the \zs ensures your changes will start after this position

2 - Using visual block selection
Start visual block selection -> Ctrl-v
use j or k to expand your selection
now press I and type what you want, after that 
just press Esc.

Suppose I have a complex C++ application that I need to debug with a lot of variables. I wanna avoid using std::cout and printf approaches (below there's an explaination why).

In order to explain my issue, I wrote a minimal example using chrono (This program calculates fps of its while cycle over time and increment i_times counter until it reaches 10k): 

#include <chrono>

using chrono_hclock = std::chrono::high_resolution_clock;

int main(int argc, char** argv){
bool is_running = true;
float fps;
int i_times=0;
chrono_hclock::time_point start;
chrono_hclock::time_point end;

while(is_running){
 start = chrono_hclock::now();

 // Some code execution

 end = chrono_hclock::now();

 fps=(float)1e9/(float)std::chrono::duration_cast<std::chrono::nanoseconds>(end-start).count());
 if(++i_times==10000) is_running=false;
}

return 0;
}


I would like to debug this program and watch for fps and i_times variables continuosly over time, without stopping execution.

Of course I can simply use std::cout, printf or other means to output variables values redirecting them to stdout or a file while debugging and those are OK for simple types, but I have multiple variables which data type are struct-based and it would be creepy, time expensive and code bloating to write instructions to print each one of them. Also my application is a realtime video/audio H.264 encoder streaming with RTSP protocol and stopping at breakpoints means visualizing artifacts in my other decoder application because the encoder can't keep up with the decoder (because the encoder hit a breakpoint). 

How can I solve this issue?

Thanks and regards!



The IDE I'm currently using for developing is Visual Studio 2019 Community.

I'm using the Local Windows Debugger.

I'm open to using alternative open source IDEs like VSCode or alternative debugging methods to solve this problem and/or to not be confinated into using a specific IDE.

To watch for specific multiple variables in VS I use the built-in Watch Window. While debugging with LWD, I add manually variables by right-clicking them in my source code and click Add Watch. Then those are showed in the Watch Window (Debug-Windows-Watch-Watch 1):


However I can only watch this window contents once I hit a breakpoint I set inside the while cycle, thus blocking execution, so that doesn't solve my issue.
"	"
You can use nonblocking breakpoint. First add the breakpoint. Then click on breakpoint settings or right click and select action.

Now you add a message like any string that is suggestive for you. And in brackets include the values to show, for instance

value of y is {y} and value of x is {x}


In the image is shown the value of i when it hits the breakpoint. Check the ""Continue code execution"" so breakpoint will not block execution. The shape of your breakpoint will change to red diagonal square. You can add also specific conditions if you click the Conditions checkbox.
Now while debugging all these debug messages will be shown in the output window:

In the above image it is showing the following message:

the value of i is {i}


By checking the ""Conditions"" you can add specific conditions, for instance i%100==0 and it will show the message only if i is divisible by 100. 

This time your breakpoint will be marked with a + sign, meaning it has condition. Now while debugging there will be shown the i only when divisible by 100, so you can restrict the output to some more meaningful cases 

............................................................
The strict answer is ""no"" but...

I think I understand what you're trying to accomplish.This could be done by dumping the watched variables into to shared memory which is read by 2nd process.A watch and a break point in the 2nd would allow you to see the values in Visual Studio without interrupting the original application.

A few caveats:


UAC must be admin on both sides to open the memory handle
This wouldn't work with pointers as the 2nd program only has access to the shared memory

The place where the error is taking place is in the encrypt-method where you generate the initialization vector (necessary for AES CTR mode). The iv is placed at the beginning of the encrypted string/byte array in bytearray[0]. Just change the line from

to

bytearray[0] = ctrTxt.toString().getBytes(StandardCharsets.ISO_8859_1);

I am new to Xcode, Makefiles, and to programming generally.

I have been given an existing C++ code to work with that is built using a Makefile. Using the Makefile I can build and run the executable on my Mac (MacOS 10.14.6) with no problem.

The start of the Makefile is

CC = g++-mp-9 -Wall -O2 -std=c++14 -fopenmp
DEBUG = 
CFLAGS = -c $(DEBUG) -I/opt/local/include
LFLAGS = $(DEBUG) -L/opt/local/lib -framework Accelerate -march=native -lfftw3 -lfftw3_threads -lopenblas -lm -lpthread -larmadillo

myproj: $(OBJS)
$(CC) -o myproj $(OBJS) $(LFLAGS)

main.o: main.cpp const.h functions.h
$(CC) $(CFLAGS) main.cpp
...


where myproj is the executable produced.

I want to use the debug features of Xcode 11 (or any modern IDE - see ALTERNATIVELY below) to explore and learn the code I want to use. Following these instructions I have created a command-line Xcode project and set up an external build target.

However when I try to build it in Xcode, I get the following error

g++-mp-9 -Wall -O2 -std=c++14 -fopenmp -c-I/opt/local/include main.cpp
make: g++-mp-9: No such file or directory
make: *** [main.o] Error 1


This is strange because my Makefile works just fine, and on the command line my system can find the compiler:

>$ whereis gcc
/usr/bin/gcc


Could someone please explain why Xcode can't find the compiler, and how I might fix it? (Also any tips/warnings about using Xcode to grok a code that is designed to be built using a Makefile would be appreciated!)

ALTERNATIVELY
I'm not wedded to the idea of using Xcode, I just thought it would be natural as I'm working on a mac. If there is another IDE with a good debugger that would be more suited to building a command-line executable using a Makefile then please let me know!

Thanks to the help of MadScientist I figured out the problem that the PATH environment variable wasn't being imported from bash (see also here). Through trial and error I worked out that I needed to set the right PATH a few places in Build Settings, and tick the Pass build settings in environment checkbox when creating the new external-build target.

For future reference, this is the full procedure I used. Recall that my problem was that I wanted to
- Import a gnu Makefile project into Xcode 11,
- The project was a set of source files and a Makefile that produced a program to run on the command line,
- The source files (and hence Makefile) depend on libraries found in a PATH that I need to set in Xcode (in my case I had installed the libraries via MacPorts).


File > New > New Project.
In the dialogue box select macOS > Command Line Tool, Product Name etc. and language. Enter your location for the project.
Delete the default target and the two default folders.
File > New > Target... to create a new target, and then Cross-platform > External Build System. Select a (Product) Name for the new target, and the Build Tool (mine was /usr/bin/make). 
(with the new target from step 4 selected in the editor area) In the Info > External Build Tool Configuration tab, select the Directory where your makefile is/will be. Ensure you tick the Pass build settings in environment checkbox.
Select the project in the editor area. Set the correct PATH to your external libraries by going to the Build Settings > All tab, clicking + > Add User-Defined Setting, then in the first column add PATH, and in the second column add your desired path to your libraries (in my case ${PATH}:/opt/local/bin:/opt/local/sbin to append the path to libraries I installed with MacPorts).
(I don't know whether this step is strictly necessary, but anyways) Click on the scheme menu then Edit scheme... or Product > Scheme > Edit scheme.... Then under Run > Arguments > Environment Variables add the PATH as in step 6.
Click on the scheme menu and select the new target so that the tick mark is next to it (so that this is the active target??).
Add the source files to the project by e.g. dragging and dropping them from Finder into the Navigation area. Ensure you tick the Add to target checkbox. 
Ensure that in your Makefile, your compiler has the -g flag set to enable debugging. 
Press Cmd+B to build.
Once built, tell Xcode where the executable is by selecting Edit scheme... (as per step 7), then Run > Info > Executable > Other..., navigate to the project folder, and choose the command-line executable that was built in step 11.
Press Cmd+R to run.


Maybe some steps are not needed, I'm not sure. I'd be happy to learn if there's a better way to do this.

Some of the modules I'm trying to import in PyCharm are not recognized (as shown in the picture). The weird thing is that for example, PyCharm is able to recognize 'linkage' from scipy.cluster.hierarchy', but not 'zscore' from 'scipy.stats', meaning that 'scipy' is indeed installed. 

I'm using PyCharm 2020.1 and Python 3.7.7

I already tried: 


Uninstalling and installing PyCharm. 
Uninstalling and installing Python 3.7.7.
Configuring my project interpreter from the start and installing all the packages. 
Using a different version of Python (3.8.2). 
Checking the Interpreter paths. 
Using a virtual environment in the project (venv folder). 
Making sure the interpreter I'm using matches the python interpreter in the Python console settings. 


Any suggestions are welcomed. 

Thank you.

I managed to solve it. I had to uninstall PyCharm and also delete its caches from my computer (which are not deleted during the uninstall). 
After I installed PyCharm again, it worked. 
............................................................
This is probably because these modules are installed in the path 


C:\Users\""Username""\AppData\Roaming\Python....


which is not a part of your environment variables. Add this path to theEnvironment Variable. For doing that you can follow the instructions here. This should probably fix your problem.

This can be seen here: (maybe different in your system)


Generally, Python is installed in 


C:\Users\""Username""\AppData\Local\Packages\Python....


or 


C:\Program Files\Python....


and only these are added to the path variable.

EDIT: 


Try doing a clean uninstall of PyCharm (remove the registry entries, left out files related to PyChram, remove the .PyCharm folder in your user directory, etc. maybe using a software) and then reinstall it.
Although its very unlikely, but in case you didn't wait for the index to be built when PyCharm opens (and also other background processes that start up), wait for them and then try again.
Also, try this: go to Settings -> Project -> Python Interpreter. In the list that appears, find the library you are missing. If the name is not there, click on the + button and install it through PyChram, else uninstall and install it through the same method.

I'm trying to find an IDE that can build Python code templates for me to get started with a large Python project. It should include typical professional / production looking code with Python 3 style, Unit Testing, API/Documentation, Code Review, Packages / Modules, Errors / Exceptions etc etc

In Visual Studio I can build this in .NET quickly ... the Project Wizards build this quickly ... but am struggling to find an IDE that can do something similar for Python. 

Any suggestion or push in the right direction is much appreciated.

In python world, IDE usually doesn't create skeleton project. There's a tool called cookiecutter, it can be used to create python skeleton project from template.
The popular python template is [cookiecutter-pypackage)(https://github.com/audreyfeldroy/cookiecutter-pypackage), which earns 3k stars. The skeleton project will include make file/setup tools, unittest, docs<sphinix), tox, pytest, lint tools, travis, code coverage and etc.
If you'd like project build with the following tools, then ppw(Python Project Wizard) is what you want:

poetry
mkdocs
github CI/CD (github workflow)
github pages for documentation
tox, pre-commit hooks, flake8, black, codecov, pytest,...
release notes auto generation

ppw is a python package which can be installed with:
pip install ppw

Which one of the above should one use if they are just getting started?

Also, if there a way to quickly edit the code files while debugging to check specific portions of the code?

For example when you have a large file like this (publicly found).

If I decide to change a variable name (forecast_filled_df, input 25), do I then have to change it manually at all other locations or can I simply find all instances and replace all like you can do in text editors? 

Essentially what I want to know is if there is a way to simply edit code in a separatelygenerated file based on a given notebook without being distracted by all the outputs and having to scroll so much to specific locations.

I find jupyter notebook is good for viewing and editing a single notebook. However most of the time, I typically want to have access to multiple notebooks and files all at the same time, which jupyter lab is capable of. In any case, I don't see any reason to choose jupyter notebook over jupyter lab (+1 for dark mode).

The text editor built into jupyter lab is decent, but is definitely lacking compared to say sublime or vscode. If I'm editing code, I'm most definitely going to opt to use my favourite text editor and use it to only run and modify jupyter notebooks. It's good for rapidly prototyping python code, exploring data, or making quick models. This is especially useful if your a data scientist. You can always convert your jupyter notebook into a python script if you need to.

Also, you can use jupyter lab as a way to edit code via ssh, so if you're not familiar with vim or emacs, it's a good way to edit, explore, and upload/download files. You can also open up additional terminals in jupyter lab.

One issue you might run into using jupiter lab is that it crashes easily when you try to enter very large directories or open really large files from the GUI.

Unfortunately, I don't know of any way to find and replace within a notebook, however it's possible for text files using the text editor via cmd + d on mac. 
............................................................
I think they omitted find and replace because you have to start a new session or execute all of the previous cells before the change is official. If you're in the middle of a huge session and just want to rename the variable, you could always add a cell with newvarname = oldvarname. If you don't mind starting a new jupyter session, you can open .ipynb files in a text editor and do a find and replace that way. This will also replace the variables if they appear in cached output.

IntelliJ Idea sometimes shortens short constructors/getters and setters into one-liners. (It doesn't literally affect the code, its just a view thing in the ide)

I've tried to google how to stop IntelliJ from doing this, but all the answers I get is how TO DO this, not how undo this. (not explained how to undo this in the same articles)

Here is how the one-liner looks like (again not affecting the code itself, just changes the view in IntelliJ until you click to edit that code, it will display like the second image:

I'm creating a friendly python development environment using venv and pip so users can start a jupyter notebook with all libs they can need on PYTHONPATH.
In order to remove libs not used by users, I want to log all libs loaded during their Python execution in a centralized NAS share (they run their python process on their hosts, but they can write in a central NAS share). To do so, I considered using strace -e trace=open,read python.. and filter the entries by my libs file path, but I'm pretty sure there should be a standard python lib to do such telemetry job.

You could wrap builtins.__input__ to also log the name of the module imported, then run (via the exec function, but we need to catch if __name__ == '__main__': blocks so it's likely unavoidable) the code you want to monitor:
loggy.py
#!/usr/bin/env python3

import builtins
import sys

if __name__ == '__main__':

builtins.__import_copy__ = builtins.__import__

__libs = set()

def __import_wrap__(*args,**kwargs):
__libs.add(args[0])
return builtins.__import_copy__(*args,**kwargs)

builtins.__import__ = __import_wrap__

sys.argv = sys.argv[1:]

exec(open(sys.argv[0]).read())

print(__libs)

Test script test.py
#!/usr/bin/env python3

import re
import sys

if __name__ == '__main__':
x = re.findall(r'all\w*',sys.argv[1])
print(x)

For me (Python 3.6.9) this seems to work to log all modules imported by the secondary script:
mostly@ubuntu:~$ python3 loggy.py test.py ""allways misspelling""
['allways']
{'_heapq', 'functools', 'collections.abc', 'operator', 'weakref', 'sys', 'copyreg', '_weakref', 'itertools', '_locale', 'abc', '_collections', 'sre_compile', 'enum', 'sre_parse', '_operator', '_collections_abc', '_bootlocale', '_sre', 'sre_constants', '_thread', 'heapq', 'reprlib', 'keyword', '_functools', 're', 'collections', '_weakrefset', 'builtins', 'types'}

............................................................
Problem
Monitor python processes on user python environments/workstations to determine which unused libs to remove.
Solution
I'm not sure if there's a standalone tool readily available. strace(as you mentioned in your question) + syslog is an option. I know you mentioned persisting the logs to a NAS, but I would consider also having lightweight syslog server as syslog can handle edge cases (ie: automatic retries) and provide an interface for you to be able to filter logs.

I'm using Stripe to handle payments for a subscription service I'm setting up.
I gather the relevant information from my customer, then on the server side, I use the Stripe PHP IDE to set up a new customer and create a checkout session for a price object which I've set up as a subscription. I save the checkout session ID to my database, then use that same session ID client side to take payment from the customer, via a redirect to Stripe.
The webhook checkout.session.completed, then lets me link up the previous checkout session ID with the subscription ID. Then I need the second webhook customer.subscription.updated to get the status of the subscription from the subscription id.
It feels like I'm doing something wrong here. I'm using two webhooks to get the information I need. If the checkout.session.completed webhook were to arrive after the customer.subscription.updated webhook, then my logic will fail.
Is there a better/correct way to manage this flow?
"	"
You only need checkout.session.completed here. That event indicates a successful Checkout and payment.
I would ignore the initial customer.subscription.updated event and instead, if you need that status, fetch the Subscription with https://stripe.com/docs/api/subscriptions/retrieve when you receive the checkout.session.completed event.

Here is the screenshot:

Pretty much appreciate it!
"	"
Resetting config is too radical. views.py was associated with a wrong file type (text?) in Settings | Editor | File Types

............................................................
I had the same problem, mine was listed in Settings | Editor | File Types | Auto-detect file type by content. Once I removed it from there, pycharm was once again working like a charm.
............................................................
1. Method:
Refresh Pycharm or Quit and open Pycharm again (restart Pycharm)
2. Method:
Wait for a minute, if there are a loading bar in bottom of Pycharm window
3. Method:
Reinstall Pycharm if both are not working
Happy coding!

New Google App Script IDE changed how GetUrl() works

(2 answers)


Closed last year.





I have a web app using app script from google , I've deploy it before many many times and the execution url which like ""https://script.google.com/a/macros/xxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxx/exec"" is the same in every time deployed , but suddenly after made some changes on the script , the exec. link have been changed.
I want to know the reason, because it's shouldn't be changed
"	"
In the new editor:

Deploy > New deployment will create a new URL every single time.

You want this instead:

Deploy > Manage deployments: under ""Active"" at top left, make sure you have the right deployment selected.
Then click on the pencil icon at the top right to edit this deployment.Click on the ""Version"" dropbox and ""New version"", then ""Deploy"".This will update this version with your newest code and keep the same URL as you are not making a new deployment.

I'm using VSCodium and I can't install any kind of Python support.
I have Python installed on my OS (5.6.15-arch1-1), available in $PATH.
When I follow the guide I can't install the plugin and get IntelliSense/whatever working.

code --version
1.46.1

You could check that your VSCodium has successfully installed Python extensions.
I reproduced the problem you described, and after installing the python extension, the problem is solved.
............................................................
The problem was with Python extension like Jill Cheng said, but couldn't install it due errors.
code --install-extension ms-python.python
It failed due weird error:
Installing extensions...Cannot read property 'length' of null
What I did:

Update vscodium (yay -Sy vscodium-bin in my case)
sudo chown -R $(whoami) ~/.vscode-oss
Suddenly it worked when installing from GUI again - previously nothing was happening

I assume update fixed something deep inside VSCodium, since chown didnt change any ownership in config folder.

Shortcut to switch project and editor in PyCharm?

(1 answer)


Closed 1 year ago.





I'm completely new to the Pycharm IDE and I would like to know if there is any Mac shortcut to toggle with the Project Sidebar and navigating through the opened files.
I just found out that you can toggle the debugging area by using Command + 4
I visited this link for shortcuts but could not found any info on toggling the Project Sidebar or Navigating through opened files


If anybody knows the answer to this, let me know! :)

You can toggle the project bar with alt+1 (or command/control 1 depending on your setup). It's underlined in your picture! Then you can navigate by either typing a file query or using the arrow keys.

I use Colab for writing scripts, but need a code editor/IDE to power up a web app. Basically writing code, using the output file as an input for another app.More of Colab-like frontend for a backend app. What's the best way to do this?

Usecase is similar to Hackerrank.

Output: [I@4e50df2e


I'm not sure there is some issues with the IDE or my program.

Edit:

Using .asList() solves the issue.
"	"
Your digitize is returning IntArray which on JVM means int[]. Using println on it you get an address.

To print every member of the IntArray you need contentToString (extension) method.


fun digitize(n: Long): IntArray {
return n.toString().map(Character::getNumericValue).toIntArray().reversedArray()
}

println(digitize(348597).contentToString())

............................................................
Using as.List() solves the problem.

fun digitize(n:Long):IntArray {

return n.toString().map(Character::getNumericValue).toIntArray().reversedArray()
}
fun main(){

println(digitize(348597).asList())

I tried:
- Eclipse ( Codemix plugin, Palantir TS plugin, Wild Web Developer plugin)
- VisualStudio Code

All of them seem to only show errors on open files.
Is there an IDE out there that would show the compilation errors of all files in the project?

Bonus: Is there a reason why this is not a standard feature for TS compared to other languages like Java IDEs for example?

VSCode does that if you configure a watch task. 

Configure a watch task

Add to your package.json scripts: 

""scripts"": {
""watch"": ""tsc --watch --noEmit --project './tsconfig.json'""
},


Configure .vscode/tasks.json: 

{
""version"": ""2.0.0"",
""tasks"": [
{
""type"": ""npm"",
""script"": ""watch"",
""problemMatcher"": ""$tsc-watch"",
""isBackground"": true,
""presentation"": {
""reveal"": ""always"",
""revealProblems"": ""onProblem""
}
}
]
}


Now from vscode command pallete > Tasks: Run Task > npm: watch

More

Personal thoughts

I've worked on other things that have done full typescript watching in IDEs e.g. atom-typescript (when it used my project service implementation) alm-tools (http://alm-tools.github.io/) an IDE I designed for TypeScript when the world was shifting from atom to vscode, and now planning a product aimed at UI designers that does full project watching : https://designtsx.com/

I have recently downloaded Eclipse for Javascript and Web Developers and imported one of my node JS project in it. Eveything is fine except I am not getting inline errors like I get on Eclipse for Java/C++ development.

Eclipse IDE for C/C++ :

You can get really good inline validation by installing CodeMix into your Eclipse IDE. CodeMix is based on Code (I saw you also use vs code), so you might get familiar right away.

I am using Visual Studio 2019. I cannot seem to find any option to make UML Class Diagram and generate code from it. The language which I'm working on is C#. If there is a way to do it, kindly tell me which libraries and frameworks are required in Visual Studio. You can also recommend another IDE if it does the job with a little briefing. Thank you.

First, you need to install Class Designer component. https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/visualstudio/ide/class-designer/how-to-add-class-diagrams-to-projects?view=vs-2019

After your design you can generate de code: https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/visualstudio/modeling/generate-code-from-uml-class-diagrams?view=vs-2015

When using visual studio's suggested naming, it offers me the name base,not baseView.I've managed to add the _ prefix through the options, text-editor, c#, Code Style. But I cannot see how to control the proposed field name suggestion.

I was wondering if this could be controlled so it would suggest _baseView and _baseModel etc.

This worked for me:


Go to Tools -> Options -> Text Editor -> C# -> Code Style -> Naming

You are passing in RGB values as 0 to 255. By by default color mode in turtle is 0 to 1.0. So you need to set the color mode to 255 first before you try to set rgb values like that. or you need to set your rgb values between 0 and 1.0.

turtle.color says

""""""Return color string corresponding to args.

Argument may be a string or a tuple of three
numbers corresponding to actual colormode,
i.e. in the range 0<=n<=colormode.

If the argument doesn't represent a color,
an error is raised.
""""""


color mode can be either 1.0 or 255. So by deafult colormode is 1.0 so color has this code. 

 if self._colormode == 1.0:
r, g, b = [round(255.0*x) for x in (r, g, b)]
if not ((0 <= r <= 255) and (0 <= g <= 255) and (0 <= b <= 255)):
raise TurtleGraphicsError(""bad color sequence: %s"" % str(color))


So lets say you pass 100, 100, 100 as your RGB, but color mode is currently set to 1.0. then color will multiply all your RGB's by 255.0. So your rgb will then become 25500, 25500, 25500. color will then check thateach RGB is between 0 and 255 inclusive, However since color multiplied all the rgbs by 255 since color mode is 1.0 all your rgbs now exceed 255 so color gives bad color sequence exception.

So either set color mode to 255 or pass in rgb values between 0 and 1

255 RGB

from turtle import *
from random import *

colormode(255)
def randomcolour():
red = randint(0, 255)
green = randint(0, 255)
blue = randint(0, 255)
color(red, green, blue )


floating point rgb

from turtle import *
from random import *

def randomcolour():
red = uniform(0, 1)
green = uniform(0, 1)
blue = uniform(0, 1)
color(red, green, blue )


As for it working in trinket but not others, maybe trinket is setting the colormode for you to 255

First of all I'm at the first year of computer science so I'm a beginner in programming yet, then forgive me for my lack of knowledge.

printf(""* Wellcome to the our guessing game *\n"");
printf(""*****************************************\n"");
int secretnumber =42;

Please, help me i really don't know what else i can do.

Overall, your problem is that you're trying to run a program that is interactive from within Sublime; it doesn't support that. Sublime captures output your program sends to stdout and stderr and displays it in the output panel, but it does't connect the panel to stdin.

So, the scenario you're encountering works like this:


You run your program, which is interactive (in your case it prompts for input via scanf(), and it launches and prompts you for input
You try to enter input, but nothing happens because stdin isn't connected.
You try to run your program again (or modify it and build it again thinking you might have an issue). 
The version you previously tried to run is still running in the background waiting for input you can't provide, and windows locks executable files while the program is running. So, when the linker (collect2) tries to link the executable during the build, it can't because the file is locked, hence the permission error.


You can clear the error by killing the program running in the background, which you can do via the Tools > Cancel Build if you do it before this error occurs; if you've already seen the error this likely won't work because this only cancels the most recent build, which would be the one where the error occurred.

The other thing you can do is use something external to kill it; the task manager on windows, kill from a terminal on Linux/OSX, etc. You'll need to do it this way if you're already seeing the error.

Note however that this doesn't solve your underlying problem because you're still trying to run an interactive program. In order to do that from within Sublime you need to create a custom sublime-build that allows for this. Generally you'd either have it spawn an external terminal and run the program in there, or use a package like Terminus if you want to keep it internal.

In order to set this up, you need to be familiar with the sequence of commands that are needed to compile, link and run a program in one command, which you can get by checking what the build system you're currently using is (assuming you didn't create it yourself).

This video on buffering and interactive builds in Sublime (disclaimer, I'm the author) has information and examples of how Terminus can be used for something like this if you'd like more information.

I've been experiencing some weird issues with IntelliJ IDEA on my Mac. When I copy, cut and paste, the input is usually doubled. So if I have a line like this,

println(""Awesome message"")


and then I try to cut the ""Awesome message"" part, it doubles the cut command (meaning that it actually puts println() into my clipboard). Then when I try to paste it, it pastes as println()println().

Rarely, this does not happen, but the majority of the time it does. 

Additionally when I'm typing the IDE will often not register some of my keystrokes. So if I type something like ""class User(@Id @GeneratedValue(strategy = GenerationType.IDENTITY)"", it will often times come out as ""(@Id @GentedVale(stragy = GennType.IDENTTY)"". This also doesn't happen all the time, just most of the time.

I've tried adding editor.zero.latency.typing=true into idea.properties but it hasn't helped at all. 
"	"
I wasn't able to pinpoint the problem, but after uninstalling IntelliJ IDEA, completely deleting all the software's data on my machine, and then reinstalling, the problem was solved.

Again, to clarify, merely deleting my plugins and reinstalling did not fix the problem. I had to follow the instructions written here. After doing that, then reinstalling, the problem was solved.

Sometimes a problem of this nature arises.

I use Tomcat and Inteliji Idea. I make changes in jsp pages, and when I deploy the project in a browser, Tomcat opens the old version of the jsp page, and if I make changes in the servlet, the behavior of the jsp pages changes, but the visual component does not change.

What to do so that the volume normally reloads the page ???
"	"
For the JSP reloading to work you need to use Exploded artifact configuration in IntelliJ IDEA and use the Update action (either explicitly, or by configuring the IDE to perform the Update on frame deactivation). The Update action has to be set to update the classes and resources. More details can be found in this document.

Some frameworks like JSF may introduce caching which will prevent the Update from working properly. In this case you'll need to disable the framework caching. For JSF caching configuration please refer to this answer.

To answer ""where did I also use this identifier?"" -questions, I run on macOS and the linuxes

dired-maybe-insert-subdir
dired-mark-files-regexp


followed by either of:

dired-do-find-regexp
dired-do-find-regexp-and-replace


On Windows I can get by using Emacs as my IDE without Cygwin, except for dired recursive search/replace.

Does Projectile
offer commands that will search/replace an identifier recursively without requiring Cygwin?

Does any other package make recursive search/replace possible on Windows without Cygwin?

I'm not concerned about the speed, because even after installing Cygwin, the recursive invocation of Cygwin's grep from within Emacs is painfully slow.

Update:

Recursive search/replace seems to be available in both
Helm
and
Projectile.

If true, then my question is:


Is the feature available on Windows without Cygwin?
The list of requires in my .emacs is already excessive. What is a light package that will do recursive search/replace (without Cygwin on Windows)?


Clarification:

OK. Success. [Thanks to Drew] With a .emacs containing nothing but (require 'dired+), I can search-and-replace in marked files using M-+ Q on Windows without having Cygwin installed. I'm guessing that this will also work on linux/macOS, although perhaps not quite as quickly as delegating to grep. (The ""Act on ALL files [] in and UNDER this dir?"" confirmation message will start to get tedious, but that's a separate question.)

For the present question one issue needs clarification. dired+ augments the built-in dired family of commands. Is there a way for it to take over ordinary dired-do-find-regexp-and-replace? That's because with the one-liner .emacs, and with a few marked files in a directory listing, I get

File not found - GREP
File not found - -I
...
File not found - NUL
File not found - ;


indicating that grep is still being invoked. How can tell dired+ ""I'm on Windows and I won't install Cygwin; please take over A and Q?"" (mapped by default dired-do-find-regexp and the aforementioned command).

Editorial: dired+ seems a bit overwhelming, but if it solves this one problem (eliminate the need for Cygwin on Windows), it will be well-worth figuring out how to move from the usual dired commands to dired+.
"	"
I think you're looking for a way to search files and get a list of those that match a regexp.If tags-query-replace works for you on MS Windows (without Cygwin), and I think it should, then you can use command diredp-do-query-replace-regexp-recursive, bound to M-+ Q by default, available from Dired+.

That acts on all marked files in the current Dired buffer, and on all marked files in all of the buffer's marked subdirs, and so on, recursively.

With a non-negative prefix arg it acts on all files in the current buffer and all files in all subdirs, and so on, recursively.(That is, any marks are ignored, and the effect is as if everything were marked.)



If, instead of finding files that match a regexp, you want to search through files then you can use command diredp-do-isearch-regexp-recursive, bound to M-+ M-s a C-M- by default, also available from Dired+.The files to access are defined similarly (all Dired+ dired[p]-do...-recursive commands act similarly wrt which files are identified to act on).That definitely does not require any Cygwin etc. commands - it's just Isearch.

I have a book that teaches physics for game developers.The code is generic C-style code.However, the examples use GUI's to interface with the code (variable initialization, start conditions, etc...). The GUI code is not implemented and is left to the reader.Ideally, at home on my MAC, I would like to use the GUI builder in Xcode to build these little interfaces and then use the GUI to run the code.However, I don't want to code the physics code in Swift or Objective-C, I just want to code it in C++ so that I can transfer the code to work (which is Windows and uses Visual Studios).If someone could just point me in the direction of a resource that explains how to have a MAC GUi call C++ code and do this all in Xcode, that would be great.

I have done some searches but I don't think I am a using the correct terminology to get the correct results.
"	"
This is very broad.

General principles would be to have the physics code in its own set of portable C++ files. Regular C++ and headers. Basic structures exposed, maybe expose std:: containers but keep it generic.

Beside that, use the UI builder in xcode, but only ever refer to the physics code in code you write. This will look like:

nice_physics.cpp

// portable code here


nice_physics.h

class NicePhysic
{
public:
int nice_function(float);

brandname_ui.cpp

Objective C++ is your answer. If you name your files with a .mm extension, you can use mix and match C++ features with Objective C features. You'll have two object systems running side by side. You can't derive C++ classes from Objective C classes and vice versa, but that's about the only major limitation. C++ code can construct ObjC objects and send ObjC messages, ObjC methods can instantiate and call C++ objects.

I'm using Flow for my React project as well as VSCode.

In order to make Flow supports VSCode, i've installed the flow-vs-code extension and followed the setup guidelines.

The third step is described as : 


Set javascript.validate.enable option to false or completely disable the built-in TypeScript extension for your project


By disabling the builtin Typescript extention in VSCode. The 'Go to definition' feature doesn't work at all and is very time-consuming.
( Go to Definition => No definition found for ...)

If anyone succeeded to make the both work at the same time, i would be more than glad to receive your help.

Thanks for your time, Louis

I use Visual Studio Code 1.40.1 and the vscode-flow-ide extension and have turned off both TypeScript and JavaScript validation.

I get IntelliSense and Flow type safety. I can ""Go to definition"" for a function, variable, Flow type, it works as expected. Try that extension instead.

I'm using PhpStorm and for some reason in all of my projects the header.php file got messed up. It's just greyed out and PhpStorm doesn't recognize the PHP in the specific files named header.php. The rest is working fine.



It's driving me crazy and I can't figure it out. I already checked file templates, reset it to default. Nothing helps.

I would appreciate any solution, thanks.
"	"

Go to Settings/Preferences | Editor | File Types
Locate Text entry in top table
Locate and remove header.php (or very similar one) pattern from bottom table and remove it.


Right now you have somehow told IDE to treat such file as Plain text and it does it for all files named header.php regardless of their location (quite likely it happened when you were creating new header file and forgot to enter .php part).

I must have at some point opted to use the legacy editor for apps script and now I have no idea how to switch back.
Google tells you how to downgrade but I couldn't find information on how to upgrade. Anyone know?
"	"
In my user interface, there is a button which upon click allows you to switch to the new editor:

and you can also switch back to the legacy editor if you want to:

You can go back and forth as many times you want, the only ""annoying"" thing is that an Editor Opt-out Survey appears every time you switch back to the old (legacy) editor.
Note that if you don't see that option, it means that the new editor is not available yet in your domain or account. It can very well be that your G Suite account for example does not have that option yet. You just need to wait until it will be available.

Somebody who used Notepad++ clearly knows about applying custom syntax highlighting to any text, by selecting an option from the ""Language"" menu, as shown the screenshot below;

This way, one can highlight the text, as he wish. I would like to know, is there any similar mechanism in Visual Studio Code editor, so that I can manually highlight the text even if its not done automatically.
Thanks.
"	"
You can change the Language used for a particular instance by clicking on the Language ID field in the Status bar and select the new language from the list.
This executes the command workbench.action.editor.changeLanguageMode or Change Language Mode from the Command palette.
To do a permanent Language ID selection based on the file extension define a setting
""files.associations"": {
""*.myext"": ""html"",
""*.myfoo"": ""css""
}

Why do I get this random folder named ""github"" under browser in File Explorers in Remix IDE? It wasn't there when I started using Remix IDE but after a month or two it just appeared. I can't delete it or do anything with it. It's empty and I tried restarting Remix and deleting every project and starting over but that didn't help. I have provided a picture below so you can see what I am talking about. I hope that somebody has encountered this problem but I can't find any solution online. Thanks in advance!
Random github folder under browser
"	"
github appears if you have imported some github based library like Openzeppelin in your smart sontract. However, if you remove the import from your code, the folder should automaticallly go away. Sometime remix act weirdly - and continues showing empty github folder. Try clearing browser cache/history/cookies and reload remix, it should reset to default.
Otherwise an empty github folder is harmless and you can safely ignore it.

I would like to refactor the following code:

Customer customer = new Customer();
register(customer.getId(), customer.getFirstname(), customer.getLastname());

...

private static void register(final UUID id, final String firstname, final String lastname) {
addNewCustomer(id, firstname, lastname);
}

into
Customer customer = new Customer();
register(customer);

...

private static void register(Customer customer) {
addNewCustomer(customer.getId(), customer.getFirstname(), customer.getLastname());
}

The reverse operation would be useful, too. Is there a name for this refactoring operation and is there an IDE that supports this out of the box, or via plugin?
"	"
In IntelliJ, you can use Refactor->Change Signature:

You'll get a dialog with all the method's arguments:

Remove them all, add a Customer argument and click the ""Use Any Var"" checkbox:

............................................................
In intellij:

Define an overload for the method:
void register(Customer customer) {
register(customer.getId(), customer.getFirstname(), customer.getLastname());
}


Position the cursor over the register method name

Select ""Find and replace code duplicates"" I'm the refactoring menu


This should identify the places which can be invoked using the new overload.
You can then inline the original method into the overload, if you so desire/have no remaining invocations of that method.

Okay, so this is not the best practice situation, but luckily I have an answer, so please bear with me.
I'm working on a rather large Delphi project with lots of external APIs used. Those APIs are plugged in different ways, including units wrapped into IFDEFs in the DPR itself, when they are platform-dependent. Having IFDEFs in DPR is a bad practice - sure, but it is handy to have all the units listed in the project tree to switch between them (rather than switch between projects).
So I was adding another alternative API implementation to the project and as usual - wrapped the existing solution units into the {$IFDEF SOME_API_DLL} clause and a new solution units into another {$IFDEF SOME_API_EXE}.
Anyways, I noticed soon after, that the IDE started to freeze semi-randomly after just 3-5min of coding, which is unbearable toll.. The IDE would hog one CPU (e.g. 13% on 8-core PC). I was able to isolate the cause to be invocation of ""autocomplete"", ""code completion"" (Ctrl+Space) and ""jump to declaration (Ctrl+Click).
The main question is - what could cause the IDE to freeze on how to resolve this?
I'm using Delphi XE8, but switching to other versions didn't help. Unfortunately newer 10.3+ versions (with claimed rewritten Code Insight) could not be tested/used due to third-party components.
"	"
Thanks to the bug being well connected to the new API implementation, I was able to track down the cause. So it appears that IDE does not like DPR files with IFDEFs (old news), but the real bummer seems to be that IDE handles IFDEFs okay only if they wrap only one unit.
The hint to the solution was the Project Tree, which gets auto-updated with units in DPR, but it auto-included only the first units after the IFDEF. Apparently, thats what also throws off the track the auto-completion.
Bad DPR structure that causes IDE to freeze on code-completion:
{$IFDEF EXTAI_API_DLL}
KM_ExtAI_DLL in 'src\KM_ExtAI_DLL.pas',
KM_ExtAI_DLLs in 'src\KM_ExtAI_DLLs.pas',
KM_ExtAI_SharedTypes in 'src\KM_ExtAI_SharedTypes.pas',
KM_ExtAI_SharedInterfaces in 'src\KM_ExtAI_SharedInterfaces.pas',
KM_ExtAIActions in 'src\KM_ExtAIActions.pas',
KM_ExtAIMaster in 'src\KM_ExtAIMaster.pas',
KM_ExtAIStates in 'src\KM_ExtAIStates.pas',
KM_ExtAIUtils in 'src\KM_ExtAIUtils.pas',
{$ENDIF}

Good DPR structure that lets IDE work well:
{$IFDEF EXTAI_API_DLL}KM_ExtAI_DLL in 'src\KM_ExtAI_DLL.pas',{$ENDIF}
{$IFDEF EXTAI_API_DLL}KM_ExtAI_DLLs in 'src\KM_ExtAI_DLLs.pas',{$ENDIF}
{$IFDEF EXTAI_API_DLL}KM_ExtAI_SharedTypes in 'src\KM_ExtAI_SharedTypes.pas',{$ENDIF}

I am new to C language but I use Gitpod for other languages. I would like to know how to run this simple ""hello world"" main.c program from the Gitpod interface step by step?
#include <studio.h>
void main(){
printf(""hello"")
}

Many thanks !
"	"
After fixing the errors you can compile the code with gcc main.c and run the binary a.out.
Errors as already mentioned:

studio.h -> stdio.h
...hello"") -> ...hello"");

............................................................
after the printf(""hello"")
you should put ;
//like this
printf(""hello"");

............................................................
#include <stdio.h>
int main(){
printf(""hello"");
return 0;

I'm a SQL developer user, usually, I extract data from Oracle database and store them into excel files on a daily basis, the nice thing about Oracle's SQL Developer when exporting the file into excel file, you get two worksheets one for your data, and another worksheet contain the SQL query that used to generate this report.


Now I'm using DATAGRIP IDE from JetBrains, I noticed when I export the file into excel sheet I only get the data and I don't the SQL query that I used to generate this excel file.
is there any way to add the SQL query to the exported file?

"	"
There is no possibility to include the SQL tab automatically. But every grid has it's own ""View Query"" option where you can see and copy the needed SQL.

To have this tab, please create a feature request here: https://youtrack.jetbrains.com/issues/DBE

JSON.parse of a URLFetchApp on Google App Scripts changes all colons in a string to an equals sign. It's doing the exact opposite of what I thought JSON.parse is supposed to do. I tried parsing the same string in different places and even made a node.js fetch and output all works. Seems to be a problem with Google AppScript
Example:
CODE
var res = UrlFetchApp.fetch(url, options)
var text = res.getContentText()
var json = JSON.parse(text)
Logger.log(text)
Logger.log(json)

LOG:
{""status"":{""timestamp"":""2021-03-24T16:01:13.657Z"",""error_code"":0,""error_message"":null,""elapsed"":20,""credit_count"":1,""notice"":null},""data"":[{""id"":1,""symbol"":""BTC"",""name"":""Bitcoin"",""amount"":1,""last_updated"":""2021-03-24T16:00:03.000Z"",""quote"":{""GBP"":{""price"":41091.43869808855,""last_updated"":""2021-03-24T16:00:21.000Z""}}}]}

{status={elapsed=20.0, timestamp=2021-03-24T16:01:13.657Z, error_message=null, notice=null, credit_count=1.0, error_code=0.0}, data=[{amount=1.0, symbol=BTC, last_updated=2021-03-24T16:00:03.000Z, id=1.0, name=Bitcoin, quote={GBP={price=41091.43869808855, last_updated=2021-03-24T16:00:21.000Z}}}]}

It's not a problem, it's a feature.
Instead of Logger.log(json) use Logger.log(JSON.stryngify(json)).

I am using Spyder to write scientific Python code but do not know if the following question is really a Spyder question or an IPython one...
If I create a variable (I have simple type in mind, like doubles, ndarrays and so on), its value is not shown just after creation.
So for example if I do
s = x1 + x2

I would like to see (or having the possibility of choosing whether I want to see it or not) the value of the newly created s.
With these settings, I would need to type
s

just after assignment to see the result.
FYI, the behavoir I am looking for is achieved in the Matlab console through the presence or not of a ;
Just to be clear: I am asking this question to save typing s (but sometimes the name is longer) and an Enter stroke. So you can call me lazy if you like.
"	"
This is not how Python works; assignments do not have values.
There is a hidden config option in IPython/Spyder to do that but only with the last assignment of a cell.
In [1]: %config InteractiveShell.ast_node_interactivity='last_expr_or_assign'

In [2]: a = 1+1
Out[2]: 2

you can set it as well in your IPython configuration file, and the values this can take are ['all', 'last', 'last_expr', 'none', 'last_expr_or_assign']
from ipython --help-all
--InteractiveShell.ast_node_interactivity=<Enum>
'all', 'last', 'last_expr' or 'none', 'last_expr_or_assign' specifying which
nodes should be run interactively (displaying output from expressions).
Choices: any of ['all', 'last', 'last_expr', 'none', 'last_expr_or_assign']
Default: 'last_expr'

This might not work in all cases, like tuple assignment, unpacking and co, feel free to open bug reports if you encounter those case.
I would also warn you that the internal way this work in IPython is really tricky so it may have unintended consequences.

I don't know this is off topic or not, I'm using general channels. Is there a solution for Search Anywhere in PhpStorm. I work with Laravel but when I use the feature I can't find the file even though it exists.

"	"
Looking at your screenshot: based on the fact that ALL files in the project tree have that sort of ""dirty yellow"" background color... it looks like ALL of your files are considered excluded / outside of the project for some reason.
Most likely a user error of some kind. E.g. you may have opened it from a different path (i.e. when symlink is involved), may have c=misconfigured it later somehow (marked folder as Excluded by mistake or whatnot) or maybe even some sort of config file corruption (pretty unlikely).
Anyway, please do this:

Close your project
Go to the project root folder and delete your .idea subfolder (that's where your project settings are stored).
If you have that project still visible in the IDE (Recent Projects on the Welcome screen) -- you may remove it there as well (to avoid any possible confusion).
Now create a new project in PhpStorm from scratch using existing files: just use ""Open"" and point to the folder with your project.

............................................................
Please check filter option. If you are doing file search then click on Files tab.

Before today, I was able to use the quick fix option to generate methods on a class that implements a given interface. I would simply begin the class definition; something like:
export default class MyService extends BaseService implements IMyService {

}


Then I would hover over the class name (i.e. MyService).
There would be a red squiggly line under the class name, because the members of the interface (i.e. IMyService) had not been implemented. After hovering a moment, the quick fix menu would pop-up and I could select an option to generate the members.
Today, everything is working as before, except when the quick fix menu pops-up it states: No quick fixes available, even though it states the members that should be added to the class to correct the error.

I've disable all my plug-ins and have restarted the application, but the issue persists.
The interface I'm currently working with is composed of 4 required methods. The base class my class is extending has no conflicting members with the interface, and the problem persists when I remove the extends clause.
How can I fix this? Is there something I'm doing to cause this?
"	"
Missing Dependencies
The problem was, my interface required the Request and Response modules from the express package. Once I imported them into the class file I was able to use the quick fix.
import { Request, Response } from 'express';

I don't think so. It's one at a time.

I tried searching if we can generate code for multiple classes at once using IntelliJ's ""generate code"", I didn't find any option for such activity. Tried few options in local too with no success.
