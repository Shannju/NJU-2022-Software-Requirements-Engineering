Problem Description
I need to configure the proxy manually in my emulator through Android Studio. From the official Android documentation, it is suggested that this change can be made in the ""settings"" tab of the emulator's extended controls. The problem is that it seems to me that this documentation is outdated, as this setting is no longer displayed in the ""settings"" tab of the Android Studio emulators' extended controls.

You can open old emulator version by unchecking setting here
If you struggle to close your old emulator, try killing qemu... process

You can go to setup proxy in Android Studio itself.

Configure Proxy in the Preferences window


Go to Preferences window (Mac: cmd+, shortcut).
Click Appearance & Behavior on the left panel
Click System Settings on the left panel
Click HTTTP Proxy on the left panel
Setup your preferred proxy settings
Confirm by clicking OK


You need to restart emulator to apply your changes

The downside of the solution is that the proxy is also applied to Android Studio itself. So traffic from Android Studio goes through the proxy.
............................................................
After a while trying to find solutions to this problem, I saw that an emulator running outside android studio provides these options. To run a standalone Android Studio emulator see the official documentation or simply enter the command:
emulator -avd <avd_name>

In my case I'm using an avd named PIXEL 4 API 30, so the command will be emulator -avd PIXEL_4_API_30. If you are on Windows you may have problems running this command so I suggest you see this.
Edit
The solution proposed by @Inliner also solves this problem.

I am looking for how to deactivate the structure view of PhpStorm and remove the dropdown.
What I want to disable:

You need to disable ""Show Members"" option.

Either right click on the ""Project"" tool window header or click on the Cog icon
Ensure that ""Tree Appearance | Show members"" is unchecked.

I'm looking for opinions on the best development language to use to maintain one set of high-level application code for apps that can execute on Android and Raspberry Pi.
",https://stackoverflow.com/questions/70952453/best-language-for-android-and-raspberry-pi,"
As of now Android only supports Java and Kotlin. Java is also supported on on Raspberry Pi. I have seen some people talk about using Kotlin on Rasberry but I think community support will be very limited if you go with Kotlin.
Also are you sharing code between the 2 platforms?? If you are sharing code then Java seems a safer bet as of now than Kotlin but if both code bases are not sharing anything and you you can use Kotlin for Android and any other supported language like Python Java JS or C for Rasberry Pi
............................................................
Thank you for taking the time to offer your thoughts.
I've decided to use Dart, along with the Webstorm IDE.Dart is an OOP language, multiplatform (potentially platform independent), and can compile to bytecode, Javascript or host object code.It sounds pretty exciting... we'll see after I have completed a couple of projects ;-)
https://dart.dev/overview
............................................................
As of now Android just sustains Java as well as Kotlin. Java is likewise sustained on Raspberry Pi I have seen some individuals speak about using Kotlin on Rasberry yet I assume area support will be extremely minimal if you choose Kotlin.
Likewise are you sharing code in between the 2 systems?? If you are sharing code after that Java seems a safer wager already than Kotlin however if both code bases are not sharing anything as well as you can utilize Kotlin for Android and any other supported language like Python Java JS or C for Rasberry Pi.

Virtual emulator by default is now dock with the IDE itself instead of floating window, thus I changed its View Mode to Float and later Window. Now it seems scrolling no longer works properly on both setup and I believe there is a bug going on here based on the experience I am getting. Whenever I scroll up or down using a mouse, the virtual device disappear and running it again will prompt the user that the device is already running. The question is where did the emulator go? I cannot see it on any tab either.



",https://stackoverflow.com/questions/70912354/bug-on-emulator-android-studio-chipmunk-2021-2-1-canary-7,"
The emulator tool is located on the right side of the IDE. When the emulator tool is closed, the emulator is still running so you need to just click on ""Emulator"" on the right side of the IDE. However, as you mentioned, it is buggy and sometimes you have to stop the emulator and rerun to get it to display again.
However, to make things easier, you can launch the emulators in their own separate windows. It seems to be more user friendly.
To get the emulator to launch in their own windows, you have to disable the the ""Launch in a tool window"" setting. Here are the instructions to disable it.
Android Studio on Mac:
Go to Android Studio->Preferences->Tools->Emulator and then uncheck ""Launch in a tool window""
Android Studio on Windows:
Go to File->Settings->Tools->Emulator and then uncheck ""Launch in a tool window""
Now your emulators will open in their own windows and you can even open multiple emulators and view them side-by-side if you wish. With the Emulator tool, it was impossible to view multiple emulators side-by-side. Instead, you had to switch emulator tabs.
............................................................
Please press long click on power button of the emulator and then press power off.enter image description here
............................................................
make sure your source code app there is no error compiling, then just click button Run your code (not button run / play emulator), when your app delivered to emulator, your emulator appear back again
button run app on the right

For some reason I cannot use the following:

Ctrl + c (copy)
Ctrl + v (paste)
Ctrl + z (undo)

In the settings I did the following:
( File > Settings > Keymap )

Reset Keymap.
I chose a different type of keymaps (Windows, Gnome, NetBeans, and more).
I searched for the hot-keys to check that they are correct. Everything was registered correctly.

I always restarted the IDE
OS: Zorin OS

Android Studio Version: Arctic Fox 2020.3.1 Patch 4
Update now: Bumbiebee 2021.1.1

What must have gone wrong ?
Kind regards.

yesterday i tried to code an example script with perl and itorrents api, i'm using the perl IDE Padre. Basically, this script sends data to a server (itorrents) here's the link of the api: itorrents.org/automation i copied and pasted the code that the website gived to me, and it's not working!
I installed this perl modules with windows cmd:
cpan App:cpanminus
cpanm MIME::Base64
cpanm MIME::Parser
cpanm MIME::Tools
cpanm Test::XML
cpanm SOAP::Lite
cpanm SOAP::WSDL

This is my script (caching.pl):
#!/usr/bin/perl

use MIME::Base64 ();
use SOAP::Lite ();

open( FILE, 'my.torrent' ) or die ""$!"";
while( read( FILE, $buf, 60*57 ) ) { $tor .= MIME::Base64::encode( $buf ); }
close( FILE );

$infoHash = SOAP::Lite->service( 'http://itorrents.org/api/torrage.wsdl' )->cacheTorrent( $tor );

print $infoHash;

Thanks in advance, im not fluent in this language, sorry.
Edit: sorry i forget to post the error line:
Service description 'http://itorrents.org/api/torrage.wsdl' can't be loaded: 500 Can't connect to itorrents.org:443

",https://stackoverflow.com/questions/70785681/simple-perl-script-doesnt-work-with-itorrents-api-12-lines,"
Solved ! I solved it downloading the torrage.wsdl file from http://itorrents.org/api/torrage.wsdl and replaced this line:
$infoHash = SOAP::Lite->service( 'http://itorrents.org/api/torrage.wsdl' )->cacheTorrent( $tor );

With this line(replacing the website URL with the downloaded file torrage.wsdl path):
$infoHash = SOAP::Lite->service( 'file:///C:/Users/sussq/Desktop/perl2exe/torrage.wsdl' )->cacheTorrent( $tor );

For more information and explanation see this post: SOAP::Lite can't connect to host

I am applying scripts in Google spreadsheets.
Using the debugger it is easy to to find errors in the script that is local to the spreadsheet (container). In the script I use functions of external libraries, which is running fine.
However, when using the debugger I am not able anymore to enter the library script. The debugger works fine as long as the script is local. But as soon as an external function is called I get an error

Cannot connect to server

when entering the code.
Using the execute command from within the debugger works fine.
Question
In the past I was able to use the debugging function also to debug library functions. Somehow this has changed.
Does anyone know what the reason is?
",https://stackoverflow.com/questions/70701083/debugging-google-spreadsheet-script-using-libraries,"
As per checking, it seems this is a well-known bug. Check Cannot debug library, debugger does not step in for details and bump the issue if you can.
You might also want to try and check if you can do it via the old IDE.
EDIT:
As per Rubén, seems like it also doesn't work on the old IDE too.

I've worked on my python project in PyCharm. When I'm executing its different files everything goes smoothly. However, when I'm executing the files in shell, it seems like I get errors that I don't get in the IDE.
For example, being a simplified structure of my project:
+--PROJECT
 +--data
+--myfile.csv
 +--__init__.py
 +--main.py

And being a simplified main.py:
import pandas as pd

if __name__ == ""__main__"":
 dataframe = pd.read_csv(""data/myfile.csv"", on_bad_lines='skip', sep=sep)

The execution in PyCharm is clean, while when I run it in Shell it yields:
TypeError: parser_f() got an unexpected keyword argument 'on_bad_lines'

I guess this could be a matter ofPython versions, but I don't quite see where the problem is. I have a 3.8 version inPyCharm and a 3.8.10 inLinux.
EDITED: Included the source file and its path
",https://stackoverflow.com/questions/70635388/python-different-errors-when-executing-in-pycharm-and-in-shell,"
What version of pandas do you use? According to this documentation the on_bad_lines is only added in 1.3.0. You can check that by using
$ python# start an interpreter
>>> import pandas
>>> print(pandas.__version__)

Any idea how to switch off the contextual help that covers your code above the line you are working on? It also covers the auto-complete which is super annoying.

Until somewhat recently, using the ""Delete to Word End"" functionality in IntelliJ IDEA (macOS keyboard shortcut: ⌥⌦) would delete through the end of the current line as well as any leading whitespace on the next line before the first word:
Line 1
 Line 2

=>
Line1Line2

This changed within the last year or two to keep the leading whitespace from the next line:
Line 1
 Line 2

=>
Line1 Line2

I much prefer the previous behavior.While cleaning up code for readability, I'll often pull code that is split across multiple lines onto one line using this functionality.What was previously one set of keystrokes is now two (I need to use the ""Delete to Word End"" key combination twice).What's worse, if the next line happens to not have leading whitespace, I have to override the muscle memory and only type the shortcut once, or else I'll delete part or all of the code on the following line.
As a minimalistic yet realistic example, I might use this behavior to do the following code transformation:
List<String> myList = otherList.stream()
.map(this::aMethod)
.toList();

=>
List<String> myList = otherList.stream()
.map(this::aMethod).toList();

I don't know what version specifically the change occurred, but I have a version of IntelliJ IDEA from 2016 which has the old functionality, and one 2021 with the new functionality.I think the change happened in 2020 or 2021.
Is there a way to revert the behavior to the previous functionality (or perhaps an equivalent functionality under a different name)?
",https://stackoverflow.com/questions/73550521/can-i-restore-previous-intellij-idea-delete-to-word-end-behavior-to-delete-lea,"
While it's not exactly the same functionality, the Join Lines action (⌃⇧J on macOS) accomplishes the same goal in many cases.Regardless of where the caret is on the current line, it joins the current line to the next line, in context-sensitive ways.
For the given Java method call example, it has exactly the intended behavior of moving the method call to the current line without any spaces:
List<String> myList = otherList.stream()
.map(this::aMethod)
.toList();

=>
List<String> myList = otherList.stream()
.map(this::aMethod).toList();

For a concatenated Java string split over the two lines, it will remove the string concatenation operator, combining the two strings into one:
System.out.println(""A"" +
""B"");

=>
System.out.println(""AB"");

In a plain text file, it will combine the lines, with a single space before the non-space text of the second line:
Line 1
 Line 2

=>
Line 1 Line 2

I have a WordPress site, and I teach python on it and I want to share some code on it. I want a code editor that users can see my code and run it.
Please if you know any plugin that can do this help me.
",https://stackoverflow.com/questions/73510273/i-need-a-wordpress-plugin-that-can-create-an-ide-for-codes-to-run-on-my-website,"
I really do not think that there is such kind of a plugin available as of now. However, you can always search for such a plugin inside the official WordPress plugin repository.
Still, my recommendation would be to consider building your custom website ( not based on WordPress at all ) in order to achieve that using a different application or framework that has already developed a tool for that purpose.

You need to do something as follows, as you want to repeat all the process until the user choose to QUIT the calculator app:
public static void main(String[] args) {
System.out.println(""Welcome to my calculator:"");
String operator = """";

while (!operator.equals(""QUIT"")) {

Scanner op = new Scanner(System.in);
System.out.println(""Type 1 if you wish to use the Standard calculator, 2 for the Scientific calculator, or QUIT if you wish to quit the program."");
operator = op.nextLine();
if (operator.equals(""1"")) {
System.out.println(standard());
}
if (operator.equals(""2"")) {
System.out.println(scientific());
}
if (operator.equals(""QUIT"")) {
System.out.print(""System quit"");

}

}
}

output:
Welcome to my calculator:
Type 1 if you wish to use the Standard calculator, 2 for the Scientific calculator, or QUIT if you wish to quit the program.
1
Standard Calculator chosen.
Type 1 if you wish to use addition, 2 for subtraction, 3 for multiplication, 4 for exponent, 5 for division, or 6 for mod.

Here's a solution for your ""main"" method that:

uses a ""while"" loop and a boolean value ""keepGoing"" to decide if it should loop again (or exit)
uses a ""switch"" statement to handle calling different functions based on input
if ""QUIT"" input, it sets ""keepGoing = false"" so that the ""while"" loop will exit
defines one Scanner, and names it clearly (""scanner"")
passes that single Scanner object to the methods which need it (standard and scientific)

Two other changes worth making:

remove the global static Scanner s1 – don't use global variables, it will lead to hard-to-find problems in your code
edit those method signatures to accept a Scanner parameter:
public static int standard(Scanner s1)`
public static double scientific(Scanner s1)



Here's the code:
Scanner scanner = new Scanner(System.in);
System.out.println(""Welcome to my calculator:"");

String prompt = ""Type 1 if you wish to use the Standard calculator, "" +
""2 for the Scientific calculator, or "" +
""QUIT if you wish to quit the program."";

boolean keepGoing = true;
while (keepGoing) {
System.out.println(prompt);
switch (scanner.nextLine()) {

I'm trying to setup local Windows eclipse for remote Linux development. I have encountered problem with eclipse not recognizing simple 'printf()' statement from <stdio.h>. I didn't find any helpful resources ATM to solve this problem, so wondering if you could help me with this.

Header files used from: Visual Studio Build Tools 2022, specifically I'm including this folder for stdio.h file: 'C:\Program Files (x86)\Windows Kits\10\Include\10.0.19041\ucrt'



GCC C++ Compiler as: ""C:\Program Files (x86)\Microsoft Visual Studio\2022\BuildTools\VC\Tools\Llvm\bin\clang.exe""


Eclipse IDE still highlights this as 'Function cannot be resolved':

I am not sure, but looks like 'printf' function is available at 'stdio.h':

Update:

Eclipse version used:

Using command line build is working as expected:

Program runs as expected:


So the questions are:
What needs to be done so eclipse would recognize 'printf'? e.g. Change MS Win Kits for another compiler header files? Or my eclipse configs are wrong?
If it is not possible for eclipse to recognize 'printf', is there an option to ignore all warnings on 'printf' (not highlight them)?
Let me know would you need anymore details from my side.
",https://stackoverflow.com/questions/72867903/eclipse-doesnt-recognize-printf-with-visual-studio-build-tools-2022-headers,"
After some investigation I think 'clang' is not compatible with eclipse & it's way easier to install & use 'cygwin' for such purposes.

Background: I am working with Angular (but my problem is not particular to any language or framework). In Angular, each component requires four separate files. So, we often find ourselves with 40+ files open. But, most of these files can be tiny, less than 20 lines each.
Many IDEs allow you to open your files in multiple windows. Each window can have a different panel, and each panel can have different tabs. This is great, but honestly, still isn't enough.
What I want: In addition to windows, panels, and tabs, I'd like to add another level of organization.
I speculate this has probably existed for decades, but I just don't know what it's called. At the very least, I speculate this has existed at least since Angular was a thing.
For example, here is a screenshot of VSCode with four files open across four panels. (Code taken from Angular dynamic component tutorial):

And here is a quick mockup showing what I'm looking for. Four files are open, but the three shortest ones are ""concatenated"" into one editor. Arrow-key down from the bottom of one file will bring you to the first line of the next file.

Notably, these files are not actually concatenated on-disk.
TLDR: What text editor can allow me to edit multiple files as if they were concatenated, as in the mockup above?
",https://stackoverflow.com/questions/72778854/edit-files-as-if-concatenated-as-one-do-any-ides-or-text-editors-have-this-fe,"
If the files stay as separate windows/tabs, the file editor would have to shrink each tab to a minimal height, and then tile them vertically. If any editor can do it, I suspect it would be emacs or vim. You might also be able to do it by opening separate editor windows and using a tiling window manager.
We can achieve a similar effect with some text editing magic. It would be something like:

Add a header to each file consisting of a unique separator (e.g. # === magic separator === filename my_file.js ===)
Use cat to combine all the files into one file
Edit this one file
When done, use the separator to break them up and put the text back into the original files

You could easily write some scripts for combining and splitting so you can do it quickly. You can also set up a background script that automatically runs the splitter as you edit the combined file. However, the combined file would essentially be a new file, so you could not view changes on it with git, and VS Code's CodeLens/Inline blame wouldn't work.
One option would be to develop your codebase with the combined files checked in to VCS, and then only have the splitter script as part of your ""build"" step. So you would make your changes, run ./build.sh which splits the files into some temp directory, and then run your application from there.
Lastly, and I hate to be snide, but the fact is that this problem is best solved by avoiding poorly designed frameworks that do not consider developer ergonomics. Many other languages give the developer much freedom and many tools to organize their code as they wish, rather than imposing constraints like requiring many small components to be in separate files. Java for example also had a similar problem (dunno if more recent versions fixed it) - you can only have one class per file, which creates a huge mess if you like having many small files. C# does not have this limitation and as a result C# codebases can be much tidier than Java codebases.

I've created a TypeScript library. It has an src directory with .ts files and dist/esm directory, where all .ts file are converted into .js, .js.map and .d.ts files. The library is working, it has typings but there are some problems with the development process.
In the IDE (I use Webstorm) when I click to the component from my library I'd like to open a source file from src directory. But instead I open a typings declaration file (.d.ts).
I've found out that when I add to the .d.ts file a link to a source map like so:
/// <reference types=""react"" />
import './styles/Button.scss';
export declare const Button: () => JSX.Element;
// The line below has been added
//# sourceMappingURL=Button.js.map

the IDE starts automatically open needed file from src directory.
And I'd like to know is it a correct way to open files from source directory of a library?
If it is, how can I automatically add these lines in every .d.ts files using Rollup?
If it's not, could you please describe how to do it in the correct way?

The culprit was my lombok installation.
This bug happens when using Eclipse 2022-03 and lombok 1.18.22 or lower.
To fix this I needed to remove lombok. I did this by:

deleting the ""lombok.jar"" file in the eclipse installation folder 
and by updated the ""eclipse.ini"" file in the same folder and deleting this line 
-javaagent:C:\Users\my-user\eclipse\latest\eclipse\lombok.jar

Then I installed lombok-1.18.23.
To this date this release is not available in the Download page of lombok as a stable-release.
You can get it from here https://projectlombok.org/download-edge

just clean project and make a build
............................................................
It is solved by just rebuild project
Build → Rebuild project
............................................................
Workaround: if you encounter this error generating an APK, first clean the project (Build -> Clean project)
............................................................

Open your project.
If your project files are not loaded and instead you see: 'Loading...' cancel Sync Gradle by clicking on X at the bottom, this should show your files back.
Clean Project: Build -> Clean Project
Rebuild Project: Build -> Rebuild Project

............................................................
In my case, I was unable to Clean Project as well as Sync Gradle Files, So
Eventually I was about to give up, but then I went to
AndroidStudioProjects/project_name/app/build/intermediates/apk_ide_redirect_file/debug in the file explorer and found a file named redirect
That file contained the following information
#- File Locator -
listingFile=../../apk/debug/output-metadata.json

From here, I tried to locate the path mentioned in this file and I was unable to find itSo I searched output-metadata in the file explorer from AndroidStudioProjects/project_name and I found a bunch of output-metadata files, I copied the first one and pasted it in the mentioned location, and then everything worked perfectly
Now I don't know wether this is the right way to solve this or not, but it worked...
Hope it helps you...

IntelliJ IDEA Ultimate Edition marks all my Spring Boot properties as unused.

I am aware of Unused properties in IntelliJ, but it does not help. The problem in that question was that the OP had Community Edition.

The problem is not that the folder would be not marked as Resources (see the screenshot).

The problem is not that Idea would not recognize the file as the properties file (see the screenshot).

Idea can even show correct tooltips for the properties (see the screenshot).

All the properties are used, if I remove any of them, my application stops working :)

For the record: I do not want to suppress the warnings.

Yes, I invalidated the cache.

Yes, I did reimport the project to Idea, yes, I did run mvn idea:idea.

which is now closed, fixed in version 1.4.0.

Credits: Thanks to @DiegoMN's tip.
According to the author, it should be fixed now, however now no properties are marked as unused. It is under investigation.
Elton André commented on 01 Apr 2022:

For now, the functionality that scans and verifies the usage of Spring properties is not fully implemented. For now, in this release, it will suppress all Spring settings (application*.properties and bootstrap*.properties files), to give a little more comfort to the eyes, and that there aren't too many unused warnings. As soon as possible, I will be happy to make the full version available with the appropriate alerts for unused and deprecated properties.

The question I have is more to see if I'm able to save 25GB of hard drive space. I currently have 2022 Version of Visual Studio Community installed, though the engine I'm working in requires 2019 to be installed. how ever I have all the same required packages installed in 2022 version. (the engine for some reason does not want to use the newest version of VSC and is trying to force me to revert back) so if I install the previous version will the workloads installed with VSC 2022 be used in VSC 2019 or must I install the work loads independently of each VSC edition in order for me to use it properly ? If they are able to use the same workloads am i required to connect them in some way? if they are not able to read the same workloads, is there a way to get it use the same sources?
TIA.
",https://stackoverflow.com/questions/71633158/visual-studio-workloads-shared-accros-versions,"
Visual Studio's installation is authored with two types of packages: ""standalone"" or shared packages, which are typically independent MSIs that are installed in a shared folder, or a component-specific location; and ""per-instance"" packages which are installed into the VS install location.
The former group is basically what you're asking for.However, different versions of VS may install different versions of those shared packages (e.g. VS2022 may have a newer version of a standalone component than what VS2019 shipped with, and both will get installed).The goal though is that as long as they use the same version, it will be shared.
The latter group is not shared, usually because they are tightly coupled to other Visual Studio components and attempting to re-use them across arbitrary versions of VS could lead to weird runtime behaviors.
So, to a large extent, VS does what you're trying to do, as much as it can (according to the people that create each component).

Closed 6 months ago.





Background:I am very new to PyCharm and am currently trying to run a script, which works v. quickly and without issue on JupyterLab, but not so much in PyCharm; every time I run the script, I always see a very slow 'Background Task' that states Updating Python interpreter - Updating skeleons... pandas.libs... The script takes c.10mins to run vs. 5min in Jupyter Lab.


Issue:I have not been able to triangulate why this script is taking so long to run and wanted some advice on basic troubleshooting.
Useful information:My script is being run from a network drive and does read a .ini file, for the purpose of reading API details. The script uses the following dependencies/libraries -
from configparser import ConfigParser
import datetime as date
import datetime as dt
import datetime
from datetime import timedelta
from datetime import date
import itertools
import pandas as pd
from pandas import json_normalize
import requests as requests
from requests.auth import HTTPBasicAuth
import time

Summary
My dead simple Excel workbook myTestBook.xlsb has a single empty table and a single code module with the routine test_openclose() inside. This routine just opens another Excel workbook (Mappe3.xlsx), then closes that workbook again.
When the routine is run (Alt-F8) with the VBA IDE closed, everything is fine.
When the routine is run (Alt-F8) with the VBA IDE opened, the intermittently opened workbooks keep getting listed in the IDE's project explorer. Each repetitive run leads to another entry in the IDE's project explorer.
Why is that and what can I do against this effect?
View after 6 runs with closed IDE (no entries) and 3 runs with IDE open (3 entries):

You can also see that the Workbook Mappe3.xlsx which is getting imported, is very simple too: just a single (empty) table, no named ranges, no internal or external references, no modules.
Code
I am using
° MS Windows 10 Pro x64, 10.0.19042
° Excel365 (V2201 - 16.0.14827.20158, 64bit)
° Microsoft Visual Basic for Applications 7.1, Retail 7.1.1119, Forms3: 16.0.14827.20024
Option Explicit

Sub test_openclose()
Dim srcBook As Excel.Workbook
Dim name As String

name = ""C:\Users\user1\Desktop\Mappe3.xlsx""

' Open a workbook:
Set srcBook = Workbooks.Open(filename:=name)

' Do something useful,
' e.g. enter the current time:
srcBook.Sheets(1).Range(""B2"").Value = Str(Now)

' Close the workbook and destroy the object
Workbooks(srcBook.name).Close savechanges:=False
Set srcBook = Nothing

End Sub

What I have tried
I have checked that no ""exotic"" references are ticked:

I have also checked that no ""exotic"" add-ins are active:


I have checked for similar questions and answers, but the suggested solutions do not apply to my case:

I have already coded like set wb=nothing, but to no avail
I do not use shared workbooks
I am on pure VBA, not COM-Add-In, C#, VSTO, ...
There are no add-ins

What else can I try?
",https://stackoverflow.com/questions/71189237/closed-excel-workbooks-remain-in-vba-ide,"
The effect does not show when the workbook is closed differently:
with the code
' Close the workbook
srcBook.Close savechanges:=False

instead of
' Close the workbook and destroy the object
Workbooks(srcBook.name).Close savechanges:=False
Set srcBook = Nothing

the effect is not observed.

What is the meaning of the following control characters: 


Carriage return
Line feed
Form feed

",https://stackoverflow.com/questions/3091524/what-are-carriage-return-linefeed-and-form-feed,"
Carriage return means to return to the beginning of the current line without advancing downward.The name comes from a printer's carriage, as monitors were rare when the name was coined.This is commonly escaped as ""\r"", abbreviated CR, and has ASCII value 13 or 0xD.
Linefeed means to advance downward to the next line; however, it has been repurposed and renamed.Used as ""newline"", it terminates lines (commonly confused with separating lines).This is commonly escaped as ""\n"", abbreviated LF or NL, and has ASCII value 10 or 0xA. CRLF (but not CRNL) is used for the pair ""\r\n"".
Form feed means advance downward to the next ""page"".It was commonly used as page separators, but now is also used as section separators.Text editors can use this character when you ""insert a page break"".This is commonly escaped as ""\f"", abbreviated FF, and has ASCII value 12 or 0xC.

As control characters, they may be interpreted in various ways.
The most important interpretation is how these characters delimit lines.Lines end with NL on Unix (including OS X), CRLF on Windows, and CR on older Macs.Note the shift in meaning from LF to NL, for the exact same character, gives the differences between Windows and Unix, which is also why many Windows programs use CRLF to separate instead of terminate lines.Many text editors can read files in any of these three formats and convert between them, but not all utilities can.
Form feed is much less commonly used.As page separator, it can only come between lines or at the start or end of the file.
............................................................
\r is carriage return and moves the cursor back like if i will do-

printf(""stackoverflow\rnine"")
ninekoverflow


means it has shifted the cursor to the beginning of ""stackoverflow"" and overwrites the starting four characters since ""nine"" is four character long.

\n is new line character which changes the line and takes the cursor to the beginning of a new line like-

printf(""stackoverflow\nnine"")
stackoverflow
nine


\f is form feed, its use has become obsolete but it is used for giving indentation like

printf(""stackoverflow\fnine"")
stackoverflow
 nine


if i will write like-

printf(""stackoverflow\fnine\fgreat"")
stackoverflow
 nine
 great

............................................................
In short:

Carriage return (\r or 0xD): To take control at starting on the same line.
          Line feed (\n or 0xA): To Take control at starting on the next line.
         Form feed (\f or 0xC): To take control at starting on the next page.


More details and more control characters can be found on the following page: Control character
............................................................
Have a look at Wikipedia:


Systems based on ASCII or a compatible character set use either LF (Line feed, '\n', 0x0A, 10 in decimal) or CR (Carriage return, '\r', 0x0D, 13 in decimal) individually, or CR followed by LF (CR+LF, 0x0D 0x0A). These characters are based on printer commands: The line feed indicated that one line of paper should feed out of the printer, and a carriage return indicated that the printer carriage should return to the beginning of the current line.

............................................................
\f is used for page break.
You cannot see any effect in the console. But when you use this character constant in your file then you can see the difference.

Other example is that if you can redirect your output to a file then you don't have to write a file or use file handling.

For ex:

Write this code in c++

void main()
{
clrscr();
cout<<""helloooooo"" ;

cout<<""\f"";
cout<<""hiiiii"" ;

}


and when you compile this it generatean exe(for ex. abc.exe)

then you can redirect your output to a file using this:

abc > xyz.doc

then open the file xyz.doc you can see the actual page break between hellooo and hiiii....
............................................................
On old paper-printer terminals, advancing to the next line involved two actions: moving the print head back to the beginning of the horizontal scan range (carriage return) and advancing the roll of paper being printed on (line feed).

Since we no longer use paper-printer terminals, those actions aren't really relevant anymore, but the characters used to signal them have stuck around in various incarnations.
............................................................
Apart from above information, there is still an interesting history of LF (\n) and CR (\r).
[Original author : 阮一峰 Source : http://www.ruanyifeng.com/blog/2006/04/post_213.html]

Before computer came out, there was a type of teleprinter called Teletype Model 33. It can print 10 characters each second. But there is one problem with this, after finishing printing each line, it will take 0.2 second to move to next line, which is time of printing 2 characters. If a new characters is transferred during this 0.2 second, then this new character will be lost.

So scientists found a way to solve this problem, they add two ending characters after each line, one is 'Carriage return', which is to tell the printer to bring the print head to the left.; the other one is 'Line feed', it tells the printer to move the paper up 1 line.

Later, computer became popular, these two concepts are used on computers. At that time, the storage device was very expensive, so some scientists said that it was expensive to add two characters at the end of each line, one is enough, so there are some arguments about which one to use.

In UNIX/Mac and Linux, '\n' is put at the end of each line, in Windows, '\r\n' is put at the end of each line. The consequence of this use is that files in UNIX/Mac will be displayed in one line if opened in Windows. While file in Windows will have one^M at the end of each line if opened in UNIX or Mac.
............................................................
Consider an IBM 1403 impact printer. CR moved the print head to the start of the line, but did NOT advance the paper. This allowed for ""overprinting"", placing multiple lines of output on one line. Things like underlining were achieved this way, as was BOLD print. LF advanced the paper one line. If there was no CR, the next line would print as a staggered-step because LF didn't move the print head. FF advanced the paper to the next page. It typically also moved the print head to the start of the first line on the new page, but you might need CR for that. To be sure, most programmers coded CRFF instead of CRLF at the end of the last line on a page because an extra CR created by FF wouldn't matter.
............................................................
As a supplement,

1, Carriage return:It's a printer terminology meaning changing the print location to the beginning of current line. In computer world, it means return to the beginning of current line in most cases but stands for new line rarely.

2, Line feed:It's a printer terminology meaning advancing the paper one line. So Carriage return and Line feed are used together to start to print at the beginning of a new line. In computer world, it generally has the same meaning as newline.

3, Form feed: It's a printer terminology, I like the explanation in this thread. 


If you were programming for a 1980s-style printer, it would eject the
paper and start a new page. You are virtually certain to never need
it.

http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Form_feed


It's almost obsolete and you can refer to Escape sequence \f - form feed - what exactly is it? for detailed explanation.

Note, we can use CR or LF or CRLF to stand for newline in some platforms but newline can't be stood by them in some other platforms. Refer to wiki Newline for details.

""\n"" is the linefeed character.It means end the present line and go to a new line for anyone who is reading it.
............................................................
Carriage return and line feed are also references to typewriters, in that the with a small push on the handle on the left side of the carriage (the place where the paper goes), the paper would rotate a small amount around the cylinder, advancing the document one line. If you had finished typing one line, and wanted to continue on to the next, you pushed harder, both advancing a line and sliding the carriage all the way to the right, then resuming typing left to right again as the carriage traveled with each keystroke. Needless to say, word-wrap was the default setting for all word processing of the era. P:D
............................................................
Those are non-printing characters, relating to the concept of ""new line"". \n is linefeed. \r is carriage return. On different platforms they have different meanings, relative to a valid new line. In windows, a new line is \r\n. In linux, \n. In mac, \r.

In practice, you put them in any string, and it will have effect on the print-out of the string.
............................................................
when I was an apprentice in the Royal Signals many (50) years ago, teletypes and typewriters had ""Carriage"" with the printing head on them. When you pressed RETURN the Carriage would fly to the left. Hence Carriage Return (CR). You could just return the Carriage, but on mechanical typewriters, you'd use the Lever (much like a tremolo lever on an electric guitar) which would also do the Line Feed. Your next question is why would you not want the line feed?heh heh well in those days to delete characters we'd do a CR then use a Tip-ex-like paper in between the hammerheads and paper and type the same keys to over-write with white ink. Some fancy typewriters had a key you could press. So there you go.

I have been doing some Redux-React tutorials but hit a snag when one of the lines of code seems to cause the browser to go blank (and otherwise providing no error messages in the terminal). I'm wondering if anyone knows of a way to get some sort of error diagnostics in the terminal for Redux-React code (when running npm run dev) that would be helpful in finding the root of the issue.
The line of code is:
const numOfCakes = useSelector((state) => state.cake.numOfCakes)

Which works if I replaced it with
const numOfCakes = 3

The code is in the file CakeView.jsx (from the tutorial)
import React from 'react'
import { useSelector } from 'react-redux'

export const CakeView = () => {
const numOfCakes = useSelector((state) => state.cake.numOfCakes)
return (
<div>
<h2>Number of cakes - { numOfCakes } </h2>
<button>Order cake</button>
<button>Restock cakes</button>
</div>
)
}

This makes reference to the code in the file , also from the same tutorial:
import { createSlice } from '@reduxjs/toolkit'
import axios from 'axios'

const initialState = {
numOfCakes: 10
}

const cakeSlice = createSlice({
name: 'cake',
initialState,
reducers: {
ordered: (state) => {
state.numOfCakes--
},
restocked: (state, action) => {
state.numOfCakes += action.payload
},
},
})

export default cakeSlice.reducer
export const { ordered, restocked } = cakeSlice.actions

I'm not sure what I may doing wrong. I've gone over the video tutorials multiple times checking but they seem to be the same. Maybe I'm so caught up in it that I'm missing something obvious. If the problem is not obviously in one of these files, I'm hoping someone can suggest some sort of extension (I'm using VS Code) that would issue better diagnostics. (The link is of a tutorial that is 27th in a series of 31 videos so it's a bit of stuff to work through although the videos are short and quite well done, imo...even if I am stumbled by this particular issue.)
Any help greatly appreciated!

You can log from all parts of the code and modify it whenever a variable has an unexpected value.
You can use actionCreators to execute code delays or asynchronous and check the code in different modes. In the same situations as pending or success or error, and also at the end to get errors from the server, you can create a custom hook and use it in all parts of the project that you need to request and show the answer as a modal.

.then(res=> console.log(res.data))

I've been trying to create multiple custom properties to use in my CSS files, after searching I discovered they should be prefixed with a double-dash and usually go inside of :root, like so:
:root {
--server-primary:#c38c00;
--server-secondary:#9d7100;
}

However doing this immediately gives me an error: javafx.css.CssParser parse WARNING: CSS Error parsing file:/[redacted]/ColorPalette.css: Expected RBRACE at [3,4].
I've tried finicking with this in every way I can imagine, but the only solution I have found is abandoning the use of these double-dash variables in place of the following:
.root {
-server-primary:#c38c00;
-server-secondary:#9d7100;
}

The reason I want to use the first one with double-dashes is to be able to reference these using var(--variable-name-here), which has the added benefit of actually displaying the color in my IDE, whereas just calling -variable-name-here does not show which color was used:
",https://stackoverflow.com/questions/72053832/declaring-multiple-custom-css-properties-in-root-causes-error,"
Using supported JavaFX CSS constructs
I don't think the : in var notation is supported for JavaFX CSS (I don't even know what it is, to be honest).
See the JavaFX CSS reference:

https://docs.oracle.com/javase/8/javafx/api/javafx/scene/doc-files/cssref.html.

The likely equivalent for JavaFX is:

named colors, looked up colors and color functions


Named Colors <named-color>
CSS supports a bunch of named constant colors. Named colors can be
specified with just their unquoted name for example:
.button {
-fx-background-color: red; 
}

Looked-up Colors <looked-up-color>
With looked-up colors you can refer to any other color property that
is set on the current node or any of its parents. This is a very
powerful feature, as it allows a generic palette of colors to be
specified on the scene then used thoughout the application. If you
want to change one of those palette colors you can do so at any level
in the scene tree and it will affect that node and all its decendents.
Looked-up colors are not looked up until they are applied, so they are
live and react to any style changes that might occur, such as
replacing a palette color at runtime with the ""style"" property on a
node.
In the following example, all background color of all buttons uses the
looked up color ""ABC"".
.root { abc: #f00 } 
.button { -fx-background-color: abc }

Color Functions <color-function>
JavaFX supports some color computation functions. These compute new
colors from input colors at the time the color style is applied. This
enables a color theme to be specified using a single base color and to
have variant colors computed from that base color. There are two color
functions: derive() and ladder().
<derive> | <ladder>
Derive 
derive( <color> , <number>% )

The derive function takes a color and computes a brighter or darker
version of that color. The second parameter is the brightness offset,
representing how much brighter or darker the derived color should be.
Positive percentages indicate brighter colors and negative percentages
indicate darker colors. A value of -100% means completely black, 0%
means no change in brightness, and 100% means completely white.
Ladder
ladder(<color> , <color-stop> [, <color-stop>]+)

The ladder function interpolates between colors. The effect is as if a
gradient is created using the stops provided, and then the brightness
of the provided <color> is used to index a color value within that
gradient. At 0% brightness, the color at the 0.0 end of the gradient
is used; at 100% brightness, the color at the 1.0 end of the gradient
is used; and at 50% brightness, the color at 0.5, the midway point of
the gradient, is used. Note that no gradient is actually rendered.
This is merely an interpolation function that results in a single
color.

I suggest you use these supported and documented features of JavaFX instead.
There are many examples of their use in the modena.css file which can be found inside your JavaFX installation packages (in Idea search for the file modena.css in your project libraries).
On IDE support (specifically IntelliJ Idea)
With regard specifically to the support for displaying colors parsed from CSS in an IDE, it will of course vary by IDE.
For IntelliJ Idea, which I think you are using, I think support varies depending on the version used.I think the free community edition may have limited or no support for CSS parsing and color display for CSS files.The paid (called Ultimate) version does provide support for CSS parsing and color display for CSS files.
As of 2022.1 Ultimate Edition, for JavaFX CSS, it will accurately display direct assignments of named colors as well as RGB and HSB-defined colors and some of the JavaFX color derivation functions.
It will NOT display colors that are assigned via JavaFX looked-up colors or some of the JavaFX color derivation functions. It will display stops in gradients as long as they are not looked up, but won't display the gradients themselves.Enhancement requests for the IDE could be raised for the IDE to add color display support for the looked up and derived colors and additional support for displaying gradients.

Very sorry for being late.
The terminal process terminated with exit code: 4294901760

If you're on Windows 10 1809 (build 17763) or below, the issue is
related to the legacy ""winpty"" backend. Upgrading to Windows 1903
(build 18362) will move you onto the new ""conpty"" backend that is
built by Microsoft and could fix your problem.

You can try to switch the terminal from PowerShell to CMD:
Open Command Palette (Ctrl+Shift+P), type in Terminal: Select Default Profile.
Or
You can add this to the settings.json file directly:

On android studio I can't debug real or emulated devices on a flutter project. I only see options to select Chrome (web), Edge (web) or Windows (desktop) as options on the flutter device selection dropdown window.
I can see the devices under the Device Manager menu such as when I connect my android device using a usb cable but somehow they don't appear under flutter device selection. I tried uninstalling and reinstalling everything multiple times, I tried installing the Android SDK and Android studio in different places, I even connected different android devices to see if the problem was due to my device but none were seen by the flutter device selection even after a refresh.
All the tested devices had USB debugging open so I have no idea what may be causing this. Emulated devices such as an emulated pixel 3 were similarly visible in the device manager but could not be selected for debugging. Any help would be very appreciated.

I found the problem, It was a multitude of issues that compounded on top of eachother.

I had not properly set the path for flutter, even flutter doctor wasn't working. When I properly installed flutter, flutter doctor gave me the an error to do with command line tools.

I could not resolve the command line tools issue on flutter doctor even after I had downloaded the latest command line tools from the sdk manager. I found out that the issue was due to me not installing the Android SDK in the default installation location. When I installed it in the default install location I just had to agree to the license agreements and after that it all worked properly.

I want to know what parameters is gradle receiving from my IDE.
So far, most documentation talks about passing custom properties but I want to be able to solve possible issues between my IDE and gradle.
So, how to print all command line arguments passed to gradle?
",https://stackoverflow.com/questions/72562847/how-to-print-all-command-line-arguments-passed-to-gradle,"
I'm not using NetBeans, but I can see command line arguments in IntelliJ. They are printed as first log line in the Run window. Maybe you have something similar.
See the line Executing task 'clean -i --console=plain'

Didn't find a way of how to debug command line argument options within Gradle.
For all other project and system properties and arguments to Gradle JVM itself you can use following script:
import java.lang.management.RuntimeMXBean
import java.lang.management.ManagementFactory

println(""==== START EXT Gradle Properties ===="")
project.properties.ext.properties.forEach{key, value ->
println(""KEY: $key, VALUE is: $value"")
}
println(""==== START Gradle Properties ===="")
project.properties.forEach{key, value ->
println(""KEY: $key, VALUE is: $value"")
}
println(""==== START Gradle JVM Arguments ===="")
RuntimeMXBean runtimeMXBean = ManagementFactory.getRuntimeMXBean();
List<String> jvmArgs = runtimeMXBean.getInputArguments();
for (String arg : jvmArgs) {
System.out.println(arg);
}
println(""==== START System Properties ===="")
System.getenv()
System.getProperties().forEach{key, value ->
println(""KEY: $key, VALUE is: $value"")

I've initialized a votes array and two functions to store the votes in our array as :
uint[2] votes = [0,0];

function vote_a() public{
votes[0] += 1;
}
function vote_b() public{
votes[1] += 1;
}

Now, I've created a ""results"" function which should return a string ""tie"", ""a wins"" or ""b wins"" on the basis of number of votes while also reassigning the number of votes to 0
function results() public returns(string memory){
uint a = votes[0];
uint b = votes[1];

votes[0]=0;
votes[1]=0;

if (a==b)
return ""tie"";
else if (a>b)
return ""a wins"";
else
return ""b wins"";
}

but it does not show the returned result in remix ide like a view function. And I cannot modify the state of the function to view as it'd throw an error for changing value of votes array elements. Is there any way to achieve both conditions.
",https://stackoverflow.com/questions/73171216/how-to-change-variables-value-and-use-return-as-a-view-function-in-solidity,"
This happen when you'alterating state variables defined in view functions.
Thus, view functions can only reads data from your smart contract.
To solve your issue, I tried to split the content about results() function in two functions. The first function that I called setResults() is a similar to setter functions (in other programming languages), so allows only for contract owner to handle the array values.
Second function, allows you to view the result about the comparison between a and b elements.
In the following lines, I put your smart contract adjusted where I inserted some notes:
// SPDX-License-Identifier: MIT
pragma solidity ^0.8.0;

contract Test {
uint[2] votes = [0,0];
address owner;

// NOTE: I set a 'owner' variable with the address value who have deployed for the first time the smart contract
constructor() {
owner = msg.sender;
}

// NOTE: Modifier that allow only for smart contract owner the access to specific function
modifier onlyOwner() {
require(msg.sender == owner, ""You're not the owner!"");
_;
}

function vote_a() public{
votes[0] += 1;
}

function vote_b() public{
votes[1] += 1;
}

function results() public view returns(string memory){
uint a = votes[0];
uint b = votes[1];

if (a==b)
return ""tie"";
else if (a>b)
return ""a wins"";
else
return ""b wins"";
}

// NOTE: I created a new function that allows you to handle the data inside array
function setResults() public onlyOwner {
votes[0] = 0;
votes[1] = 0;
}

}

IMPORTANT: Before call results() function, remember you to call setResults() for change the array values.

Some time ago I've created a KMM library from IntelliJ IDEA, using the ""Mobile Application"" project template. The structure was (with one root build.gradle.kts file):
libraryProject
- build.gradle.kts
- src
- androidMain
- commonMain
- iosMain

Now, that template is missing from the list. There is just a ""Library"", which creates a jvm/js/common/native structure.
In Android Studio, the KMM plugin generates (for KMM library template):
libraryProject
- build.gradle.kts
- settings.gradle.kts
- libraryShared (this can be renamed)
- build.gradle.kts
- src
- androidMain
- commonMain
- iosMain

This is just a KMM application without the actual iOS and Android platform modules.
And, it comes with two build.gradle.kts files (root and shared).
I'm just curious if I missed anything or do I have to configure it manually, somehow.

I normally upload at 921600. Your settings look perfect, it is working very well for me. Try the following -

If the Serial pins(Rx/Tx) are connected anywhere, disconnect/unplug them.
Keep the boot button on hold while it is trying to connect.
Change the USB port. If you are using hardware debuggers, zadig can mess things up.

I have faced similar issues, the above mentioned ones have always solved it. Choosing wrong board also results in this issue, I tried ESP-01, ESP-03 or other smaller boards with this setting and faced this. So make sure you are using exactly the ESP32 dev module and not anything else.

I can't provide any code because I'm under NDA, but as the title says, VS won't color my code or let me use any of the built-in tools it has. It allows me to rebuild and such, just not anything that directly edits or reveals any files. Google has absolutely nothing about the problem, everything is always VS Code. It's only for one specific project and it makes it very hard to work, does anyone know a solution? Has anyone ever heard of this problem?
It's Visual Studio 2022.
Edit:
The code is in TypeScript, with the .ts file extension, if that wasn't obvious, not to mention that it doesn't even interact with plain HTML. The only time it even colors the text is when I restart VS, then it goes back to not interacting with the text at all until I restart again, then it only highlights 2 of the files and stops again. This is the most information I could possibly give from my perspective, ask for any more you need.

I can usually fix this by simply closing VS and then reopening it.It's definitely a glitch in Visual Studio with both Typescript and Javascript files.If closing/reopening gets too annoying, there's some other things to try on this post:

I am building a desktop app in python, and I wanted to include a section where the user can write and run python code.

You can use python scripting to open python idle from the python script using code like this.
# importing the module
import os

# setting the path of the IDE
# use of \\ is important because 
# \ will be treated as a escape sequence
# here we are using the Python Idle 
# path to open the Python idle
path=""C:\\Program Files (x86)\\Python\\python3.7.exe""

# using the os.startfile() method
os.startfile(path)

In order to add the idle to your application, you can resize the window and place it within your application.

I am working in a project where I am on a specific file in a folder, the structure is like this:
└─project_folder/
├─ myFile.cpp
└─ other_folder/
├─ headerFile.h
└─ otherCppFile.cpp

Now I have a function createBoundary() in myFile.cpp, there are a lot of header files in myFile.cpp and I am not sure where the function is declared/defined. Is there a way to navigate to the function createBoundary()'s definition in VSCode or CLion? I have already tried doing that by going to options and clicking ""Go to definition"" but that didn't work and it only gave me a popup saying ""No definition was found"".
PS. If the above said thing is not possible in both the mentioned IDEs and there's another IDE which facilitates that, do let me know please.
",https://stackoverflow.com/questions/68622531/is-there-a-way-to-navigate-to-a-functions-definition-in-another-file-in-vscode,"
Using the command Ctrl + P or Command + P you can input the fileName and navigate to a file in VSCode (plus, it has some advanced features).
Now if you write myFile or myFile.cpp you can open the myFile.cpp and it also works for directories.
writing components/index in the input takes you to somewhere where the folder's name is components and opens a file named index which is located inside of the components folder
If you write myFile:122 it takes you to the file myFile.cpp and line 122.
Now if you write myFile.cpp@createBoundary it opens the file myFile.cpp, finds whatever value or function or anything that has the name createBoundary and puts the cursor on it.
If the createBoundary is inside of another object or function, you can use myfile.cpp#createBoundary. So you don't have to navigate all the way down to the corresponding line of code.
By the way, when you've already opened the file, you don't need to write the fileName anymore, just #createBoundary or @createBoundary or :122 is enough that time.

I am a big proponent of Xdebug and love PhpStorm. I have worked with many different setups for local environments and configuration seems to be a bit different each time.
My current environment is a docker container running on my local machine. I understand that PhpStorm is listening to 0.0.0.0, aka - to all network interfaces, and on a specified port (I'm using 9004). I also see that I can ping my local machine from the docker container hosting Xdebug.
What I don't understand is: when I put a breakpoint in PhpStorm, how does Xdebug know that it exists, so that when it hits that line of execution it should tell PhpStorm to stop?
",https://stackoverflow.com/questions/71784905/how-does-xdebug-know-about-breakpoints-in-an-ide,"
When Xdebug first connects to the IDE, the IDE sends over a list of breakpoints that it wants Xdebug to interrupt PHP at. If you have a look at a log file (made with xdebug.log=/tmp/xdebug.log), then you will see commands being send starting with breakpoint_set. There is then a type (-t), often line for a file/line breakpoint, as well as the file name and line number.
When PHP runs code, Xdebug intercepts the execution, and when it sees a match filename/line number combination, it pauses the execution and goes into command mode so that the IDE can send commands to inspect the current scope (by sending content_get) as well as further information about variables (with property_get). Then when you click ""Continue"" or ""Step Over"", the IDE sends a command to Xdebug to do the equivalent action.
To see a full description of the protocol, give the DBGp protocol specification a read.

Is it possible to configure the editor that when you type a tag like:
body

and hit enter/tab, the editor will autocomplete it to:
body {

}

and indent the selection to where the first property would be typed?
I've looked into Editor/Codestyle/Stylesheets/CSS but found nothing.
",https://stackoverflow.com/questions/68587027/how-to-add-curly-brackets-and-indent-after-element-in-css-through-autocompletion,"
Yes. A few different options:

Type body { and hit Enter. With default settings the IDE will insert missing }, add a new line and auto indent.
This is controlled by options at ""Settings/Preferences | Editor | General | Smart Keys"".

Type body and hit Ctrl + Shift +Enter (or whatever other shortcut you may have there in your Keymap for Code | Code Completion | Complete Current Statement action).

Write your own snippet (using Live Templates) that once expanded will replace the trigger code by inserting the snippet instead.
Lets assume that you have selected bb as the abbreviation for this snippet. Then typing bb and hitting Tab (or whatever other expand key you may select for this) will inert the whole block at once.

With Vue 2 I had no issues and I think the WebStorm Plugin is really first class - I even think it works better OOTB than on VS Code.
But I have started multiple Vue 3 based projects using the Composition API and it seems that the WebStorm Vue plugin is just not ready yet?!
Using <script setup> is pretty much unusable. And when using setup() {} method I get a bunch of weird typing errors and warnings.
I don't really find a lot of information about this online, so I am starting to think that maybe my config is screwed up?!

Same result.

I would like to use an IDE for debugging but prior to running the program (either debug or execute), I run a source command. So without any IDE, I run these commands in the terminal:
make
source foo.sh
./run my_args
OR
gdb --args ./run my_args

I tried to use Kdevelop, but I didn't find any way to tell Kdevelop to run that source command and then execute the command. I tried to use a wrapper but had no success.
So, I want to know what are the other IDE candidates. Any thoughts?
",https://stackoverflow.com/questions/68572815/choosing-an-ide-that-is-capable-of-running-source-command,"
I guess you run source to change some envs? If this action can be done before make, you can just run source xxx.sh && kdevelop
Kdevelop has the ability to change envs before run/debug, just setting it in project configure.

Use an explicit bash -c command to run multiple things from a single command:

You can add showrtucs to

and use these shortcuts when the tool window is focused to toggle between Windowed and Pinned modes.

There isn't any shortcut to do that, you have to explicitly click the small gear button and then change the view mode.

I have a webapp that was created prior the new GAS IDE was launched. Recently I noticed that while using the new GAS IDE, if I save my changes and proceed to publish those through a new deployment with the tested application's latest code using the new IDE, the new app deployment was not the one being executed which I noticed by checking the execution logs which was still showing a previous version of the app deployment being run (I was on deployment/version 76 while the logs were showing that the execution code was done with version 74, which was months old).
I searched online and I couldn't find any reports of this issue.
is there something I should be doing to ensure that my webapp runs on the latest deployment as opposed to an old deployment version?
just in case you wonder, I did make sure I was publishing the exec version of my webapp when I tested the execution (link obtained from the new ide). I was not using a dev version or any other kind.
",https://stackoverflow.com/questions/68477172/new-google-apps-scripts-ide-deployment-issues,"
I managed to get the webapp deployment versioning publishing issue fixed by switching back to the legacy editor and doing the republishing/deployment from there. After that, the code being executed on the execution log showed my latest deployment being run on the published webapp.
Weird, anyways.

I'm running PyCharm community edition (latest) and having problems getting it to stay authorized to GitHub.

I want to see how the JVM interpreter works. Can I track function calls using NetBeans or GDB? And how will it be more convenient to do this? I'm interested in starting HelloWorld with the -Xint option and see what steps are taken and see the interpreter source code.
I mean not only the result of the interpreter, but also the interpreter code itself in the HotSpot sources.
I built OpenJDK 8 from source with --with-debug-level=slowdebug option.
",https://stackoverflow.com/questions/68391777/openjdk-8-interpreter-debug,"
If you want to get an idea how JVM interpreter works, you'd better build HotSpot with a C++ interpreter. To do this, pass CC_INTERP=true to the make command.
This is a simplified version of the bytecode interpreter, written mostly in C++. The primary source file (which implements the main interpreter loop and most bytecodes) is in bytecodeInterpreter.cpp. You can easily debug this code in your favorite IDE. However, this interpreter implementation is not actually used in a production JVM; its purpose is to experiment and to prototype new ports quickly.
The real interpeter (aka Template Interpreter) is written in a platform-specific macroassembler, its sources are in src/cpu/<arch>/vm/templateInterpreter_<arch>.cpp and src/cpu/<arch>/vm/templateTable_<arch>.cpp. This interpreter is generated dynamically at JVM startup, so it's not easy to debug it: first, because this is the assembly code; second, because there is no direct mapping from the generated code to the original source files.
-XX:+PrintInterpreter option will dump the disassembled template interpreter.
Also, there is -XX:+TraceBytecodes flag in debug builds of HotSpot. When enabled, it calls the trace function before executing each bytecode instruction. This can be helpful while debugging the interpreter.

When I try to see the side menu upon clicking ""show annotate"" this message appears only on this file. Other than that annotations work for all other files.

number of lines annotated by git is not equal to number of lines in
the file. Check file encoding and line separators

This problem occurs in Intellij. And in my case in Android Studio

I know it isn't the solution but I wasn't able find out the root of the problem
but I share what I did to get it working.
This happened to me after I hibernated my win 11 (WSL2 and docker) and the next day I tried to work.
After I restarted phpStorm it said, git was not even installed.
I did

git reset hard and clean,
reopened the project inside phpStorm, (after this it was still broken)
restarted the computer

after all of this it started to work again.

WSL2, Windows 11, Goland GoLand 2022.1.2. Same problem.
IDE restart didn't help, what helped is to restart the WSL2 env:
wsl --shutdown ubuntu

Before restart you should close the IDE.
............................................................
Was seeing this issue in both intelliJ and PyCharm at the same time
for the same file. I did not check if the issue persisted with any
other file (perhaps should have).
Though that putting the IDE in power save mode may have done it but
removing from power save mode did not work. Restarting the IDE by invalidating cache did not help either.
Then I realized that I had put that particular file to be assumed as
unchanged by running git update-index --assume-unchanged <filename>
Once I undid that by running git update-index --no-assume-unchanged <filename>, the warning went away - and the IDE showed all of the
lines properly annotated again.
HTH
............................................................
faced this issue in GoLand (sibling of IntelliJ) 
and, when opened the same project in VSCode, its working fine.
This gave a hint, that something is wrong in .idea folder, 
removed the .idea folder and opened the project again in GoLand, 
It Worked & annotation works well

I am using Sublime Text 3 in Windows 10. I am trying to output a simple program in an output file. Earlier it was working fine, but now it is giving some strange alphanumeric characters as output whenever I am trying to output something.
Here's my build profile:
{
""cmd"": [""g++.exe"",""-std=c++17"", ""${file}"", ""-o"", ""${file_base_name}.exe"", ""&&"" , ""${file_base_name}.exe<inputf.in>outputf.in""],
""shell"":true,
""working_dir"":""$file_path"",
""selector"":""source.cpp""
}

Sample input
#include <iostream>
using namespace std;
int main() {
for (int i = 0; i < 10; i++) {
cout << i << endl;
}
}

Output:
300d 0a31 0d0a 320d 0a33 0d0a 340d 0a35
0d0a 360d 0a37 0d0a 380d 0a39 0d0a 

",https://stackoverflow.com/questions/67761068/sublime-text-3-not-showing-correct-output-c,"
It happened with me also; I use C++14 in sublime text 3.
I would suggest to delete your sublime build file and create the same again, and your ""inputf.in"" and ""outputf.in"" files should be present in the same folder.
There's a common confusion, as we copy the sublime build file from somewhere and there may be different file names for input and output files, so match them with yours, otherwise you'll get an error - ""system can't find file specified"".

How can I implement an annotation(let's say @Dangerous) like @Deprecated to warning coders this is a dangerous method, use it carefully when calling.
And the best result is the IDE has some different UI to prompt coders like @Deprecated.

Can I add an extra folding part to my code? like as it does for if, for, etc. just dol the part I want to. (look at the picture) is there any shortcut to do this or any extra extensions?
I'm using Clion. but if you know this for any other IDEs I like to hear that.
thanks in advance
this is an example of what I meant
",https://stackoverflow.com/questions/70450976/add-a-folding-part-to-ide,"
This applies specifically to CLion.
A shortcut
You're going to want to select the code in question, and press Ctrl + Alt + T (on Windows at least). That shows a drop-down menu. One of the options available is <editor-fold...> Comments. Select that, and you're good to go.
Manual input
Another approach is to add the markers yourself. Say you want to add foldability to:
int i = 0, j = 0;
char c; 

Then you can just add:
//<editor-fold desc=""Description"">
int i = 0, j = 0;
char c;
//</editor-fold> 

The desc attribute is optionnal but pretty cool, it displays your description when the code is folded.

Unfortunately, Spyder can't do that for you at the moment.

I've been having an issue with Visual Studio where parts of the background processes are constantly crashing and throwing exceptions.
To re-create it I just simply create a new .NET 5 console project, and open it and this is what I am greeted with:

I use several associative arrays in my PHP application and I'm using PHP documentor to comment my sources. I never really did specify comments for the arrays in an array, but now I need to do that and don't know how.

$array = array('id' => 'test', 'class' => 'tester', 'options' => array('option1' => 1, 'option2' => 2))


How do I comment this array in the correct way for @var and @param comments?
I could do this like this, but I don't know if this is correct:

@param string $array['id']
@param string $array['class']
@param int $array['options']['option1']


But how to do this for the @var part?
",https://stackoverflow.com/questions/2713710/comment-associative-array-in-php-documentor,"
You can't document each key, but you can tell phpDocumentor what type it is.

You could do something like this:

/**
 * Form the array like this:
 * <code>
 * $array = array(
 * 'id'=> 'foo',// the id
 * 'class' => 'myClass', // the class
 * );
 * 
 * </code>
 *
 * @var array[string]string 
 */
$array;

............................................................
I would look at the WordPress Inline Documentation Reference for some hints, though it's not currently comprehensive.

Use @param or @var or @property, whichever is appropriate in your context

According to those guidelines, you might document your associative array like this:

/**
 * @property array $my_array {
 * An array of parameters that customize the way the parser works.
 *
 * @type boolean $ignore_whitespace Whether to gobble up whitespace. Default true.
 * @type string $error_level What the error reporting level is. Default 'none'.
 * Accepts 'none', 'low', 'high'.
 * }
 */

............................................................
For me this works fine in PhpStorm for nice return value description:

/**
 * @param string $requestUri
 * @return array[
 *'controller' => string,
 *'action' => string
 * ]
 */

You can use a Pin tab feature of PyCharm: right click on the tab or click to the button. After that this tab will stay, so you can see what have been executed.

Other way to do that is clicking on Import Test Resultsbutton, which would give you possibility to switch to recent test executions:

This may happen because your pycharm is using a different interpreter than your command line.
To solve it:
In Pycharm, go to File, settings, project Interpreter, in the right top corner click the + button. Search for openpyxl and click Install package to install the latest version of the package.

In the legacy Google Apps Script Editor, you could easily create additional Projects that were bound to the parent Sheet / Doc / Slide, under File -> New -> Project.

I've read a number of articles talking about the new editor.And for the most part, I agree that it's a great step forward (finally - code blocks!).It's a shame that Find only looks in the active file now, whereas it used to look across all files in the project, but I can get over that.But nothing I've read indicates how to create additional Project bound to the container.Is this feature gone, or am I just missing it somewhere?

I've been using OMNeT++ for a week, I'm still learning.
I'm learning it as university homework, and I have to send some data about a router from the router itself to a host. In other words, I have to notify a server of the router status.
My professor told me maybe I can use the module called Probe to collect data.
I thought of using the RadioMedium in order to be able to send the data from the router to the Probe, and linking the probe to the server.
But all of this seems useless given that I could use the wlan interfaces of the two nodes (and given that the probe has no gates).
Searching on the web I found that I could use Direct Messages, and I wondered if I could implement a direct message from router to server in the .ini file.
I'd like to know how to do it in details. If that's not the right approach, I don't know what else to do.
I'd prefer not to change the C++ files, as I don't know how to program and even the professor told me to not change the C++ files.
Thank you.
",https://stackoverflow.com/questions/65672729/how-to-set-a-direct-message-in-the-ini-file-in-omnet,"
In OMNeT++ models, different aspects of the system are specified by different files:

INI files are used to specify parameters and configuration
NED files are used to specify topology of the network (and the internals of nodes)
C++ files are used to specify the behavior of the different modules

The thing, you want to achieve (sending some specific data to a host from a router, and I guess also receiving at the host and processing it (otherwise, what's the point?)) is clearly a behavior, so you have to write C++ code.
Most likely you have to write an UDP application, that is installed in both the router and the host and they talk to each other using UDP packets.

The behaviour of the Go To Implementation function accessed from the editor context menu or by clicking Ctrl-F12 in Visual Studio has somehow changed in my installation of VS2019.
It used to be that when I used it with the cursor on a method name reference, it would jump directly to the method's implementation unless there were multiple implementations; then it would show them in the Find Symbol Results window.

Furthermore, it shows a duplicate of the single implementation or of each if there are more than one.

I had been using Platform-IO up to 2019 but when I reopened a project things started getting worse and worse. Tasks disappeared and it took a while to be able to compile again. Now Platform-IO has disappeared completely and I was getting deprecation warnings in the ""Toggle developer tool' console.

Is there a way to overgo that without using Java 11? We have to stick to Java 8 for now.

I have been moving from a few days to the 10.4.2 version of Delphi. I immediately noticed a strange problem, the list of the IDE that is used to search for the methods related to the loaded unit in some cases remains empty, so it is not possible to use it to pass to a certain procedure.
After some tests I realized that the problem essentially depends on a procedure, which in my code is present in the definition of all the packages that are used as plugins by the main program, the responsible procedure is the following:
function Command (Id: integer; Params: ansistring; Proc: TProc <TObject> = nil): ansistring; override;

to give the problem is essentially ""= nil"", if I remove it, all the methods magically appear again in the list.
This did not happen on RIO (I haven't tried the previous versions of Sydney), does anyone have any idea how to fix it or will we have to wait for the new update?

You can turn on Classic Code Insight.
Open Options -> User Interface -> Editor -> Language -> Code Insight tab
There you have combo box where you can choose Code insight manager. Instead of Delphi (Language Server Protocol) you can use Delphi (Classic Code Insight) that was used in previous Delphi versions.

I want to try using the new new Metal-based rendering pipeline on macOS for Java 17, as explained in JEP 382: New macOS Rendering Pipeline. The new feature is not enabled by default. To switch from the default (OpenGL) to the new feature (Metal), one must supply the JVM with command-line arguments upon launch:
-Dsun.java2d.metal=true

I would like try running IntelliJ under Metal rather than OpenGL. So I need to convince IntelliJ to (a) Use Java 17, and (b) pass that argument to the JVM driving its own operations.
I understand that IntelliJ runs on its own internally-bundled JVM rather than the JVM installed on my Mac. So:

How do I know the version of the JVM being used by IntelliJ?
Can I point IntelliJ towards another JVM for its own operations, for a later version of 17 (understanding that I am operating IntelliJ in an untested and unsupported environment)?
How do I pass a command-line argument to that JVM when IntelliJ is launching?

I am using IntelliJ IDEA 2021.2.2 (Ultimate Edition) on macOS Big Sur on MacBook Pro with Apple Silicon (M1 chip).

I am not asking about how to pass command-line arguments to an app being developed within IntelliJ. So I am not asking about how to use the Run/Debug Configurations feature of IntelliJ. That topic has been asked and answered many times already on Stack Overflow.

How do I know the version of the JVM being used by IntelliJ?

You can find that in the 'about' dialog:


Can I point IntelliJ towards another JVM for its own operations, for a later version of 17 (understanding that I am operating IntelliJ in an untested and unsupported environment)?

Technically you can, but it might cause problems in your IDE I think? There's a warning in their documentation, see Change the boot Java runtime of the IDE to switch to a custom JDK.

How do I pass a command-line argument to that JVM when IntelliJ is launching?

Once your IDE is running, go to Help > Edit Custom VM options, see their Advanced configuration page.

Start typing in the terminal. follow each command you type with the enter key.
Use the command ls to list all the files in your directory. One of those files should be the code you just wrote and saved.
It's not a requirement, but will make it easier to have the filename end in '.cpp'. If your file does not have that, you can save the file again and add '.cpp' to the filename.
Assuming that your filename is ""hello.cpp"", use the command g++ hello.cpp to compile your code. This will create another file called a.out.
You can now run your code with the command ./a.out. After doing this you should see that ""HelloCS50"" has been printed onto the screen.
............................................................
1: save your file name with .cpp extension. If your file does not have that, you can save the file again and add '.cpp' to the filename.
2: Consider that your filename is ""hello.cpp"", use the command make hello to compile your code. This will create another file called hello.
3: Now you can write your code with the commond ./hello. After doing this you should see the Output.

(Based on rioV8's comments).
In C++, & has different meanings depending on context. It can be the address-operator, it can denote a reference, it can also be a binary bit-and operator. To distinguish all these, you need to parse the tokens next to it. && is only marginally simpler, it can't be a unary operator.
In T & x, you need to know if T is a type or a value. That requires applying C++ name lookup rules on T. We can see in your example that it's typename T. However, Visual Studio Code does not parse C++ to color the text, and therefore gets the category wrong. You cannot fix this; this needs to be fixed by Microsoft.

Basically after changing files in PhpStorm and commiting I get a lot of these blank line changes but I haven't touched any of them.

I turned on ""keep indent on empty lines"" and turned off ""remove trailing spaces"" but it didn't fix the problem.
What's going on here? For now I have to stage lines instead of whole files to avoid pushing garbage changes but that's less than ideal.
",https://stackoverflow.com/questions/70009146/phpstorm-is-doing-something-with-blank-lines-so-that-they-are-shown-as-changes-i,"

I turned on ""keep indent on empty lines"" and turned off ""remove trailing spaces"" but it didn't fix the problem.

Settings/Preferences | Editor | General | Remove trailing spaces on: is indeed the option that controls such behaviour. As per your description you already have that disabled.
If you have .editorconfig files in your project then corresponding setting from there (trim_trailing_whitespace) will overwrite corresponding IDE settings. It is expected as it's the whole nature of such files.
In this case you have a few options here:

either edit your .editorconfig file accordingly (https://github.com/editorconfig/editorconfig/wiki/EditorConfig-Properties#trim_trailing_whitespace)

or disable such support in the IDE (Settings/Preferences | Editor | Code Style | Enable EditorConfig support)


or even more radical one: disable EditorConfig plugin completely (which affects the whole IDE: all projects / code styles).

Use the history button on the bottom right of the editor window.
Then click on differences button at the bottom right side and select two versions you want to compare. Probably the ""buffer"" which is what you see in the editor and another file you saved before (You have data and time). The number of files in the history can be changed with one of Delphi option.
Then in the bottom part of the window, you see the first difference. Use the Shift+Ctrl+F8 to skip to next difference (Shift+Ctrl+F7 for previous).

I am testing/learning webhook. How to send, receive it. So I thought I would use GAS.
I have this simple script and I wonder why Logger does not work. In Projects/Executions I can see that the script doPost was executed but no logs. Email was sent and the script returned the value.

using old, Legacy Editor (no idea how to get the new one)
in Menu-Resources-Cloud Platform Project is said ""This script has an Apps Script-managed Cloud Platform project.""
when I open the project in editor I get this message ""This project is running on our new Apps Script runtime powered by Chrome V8.""
exception logging set to ""exceptionLogging"": ""STACKDRIVER"" is set to default

I tried console.log(e); but it did not work for me.
function doPost(e) {

 Logger.log(""I was called"")
 if(typeof e !== 'undefined'){

Logger.log(e.parameter);
Logger.log(""I was called 2"")

});

}
return ContentService.createTextOutput(JSON.stringify(e))

If you want your own custom log information to go to Stackdriver, then you need to create a Google Cloud Platform project, and associate that GCP project with your Apps Script project.
First create a new GCP Project:
Go to your GCP dashboard:
https://console.cloud.google.com/home/dashboard?authuser=0
In the blue bar at the top, there is a drop down menu for project names.Click that, and a dialog should appear with a button to create a new project.
Create a new Google Cloud Platform project.
Copy the Project Number.
Go back to the Apps Script editor.
From the legacy Apps Script editor, click the ""Resources"" menu.
Click Cloud Platform project.
Paste in the Project Number and click the button.
Now, any console.log() statements you have will send the logs to Stackdriver.
And Stackdriver can be viewed in your browser.
Note: Some people set up their own logging system to log information from server side Apps Script code to a Google Sheet.There are some open source repos that are available.
The new code editor does have a ""built-in"" way to log server side information to a log pane code editor window.But, of course this assumes that you are running code from the code editor.This new feature avoids the need for changing browser tabs to see your logging output.I don't know of any way to log server side info to your browser console.You could save log info into an object, and then send it back to the client after the server code completed, and then log everything in the console.
The way that it might be possible to get logging information depends on how the code was originally triggered.

From code editor
From a user using your app
From a Http Request to your Web App

Logging in Apps Script works differently depending upon:

run time version being used - V8 or DEPRECATED_ES5 - Set in appsscript.json file or through the ""Run"" menu in the Legacy editor, Set in ""Settings"" in new IDE - New Apps Script projects default to V8 so chances are your project is using V8.
Is your Apps Script project associated with a Google Cloud Platform
(GCP) default or standard project
Is exception logging set to ""exceptionLogging"": ""STACKDRIVER"" - Set in appsscript.json file - Default is always to include it - Probably already correct unless you deleted it.
Using either Logger.log or console.log
Using console.log in the server "".gs"" file or client side "".html""
file.console.log can be used in both server and client side code
but the log print out goes to different places.You can't see logs
in the browser dev tools from a console.log statement in your
server code.If you use console.log in server side .gs files, and the Apps Script project is not associated with a standard GCP project, then the log only gets sent to your ""Executions.""I believe that the only way that you can get your logs sent to Stackdriver is by using a standard GCP project.The problem with that, is that you only have so many GCP projects that you can use without requesting an increase in your quota.

Plus there may be issues (bugs) depending upon how you have logging set up and other factors.
For example:
https://issuetracker.google.com/issues/134374008
............................................................
As lots of people specified, you can use console.log for this.
However, I also work with webhooks from time to time. And I find it much more comfortable to debug directly into google spreadsheets, using code like this
function doPost(e) {
log('# doPost', JSON.stringify(e));
try {
// Some webhook-processing logic here
if(e.parameter.action == 'test-error') {
item.something = nothing;
}
if(e.parameter.action == 'test-log') {
log('# custom log', 'Some data');
}
} catch(error) {
log('# error', JSON.stringify([error, error.stack]));
}
}

function log(event, message){
SpreadsheetApp.getActive().getSheetByName('Log').appendRow([new Date(), event, message])
}

Example spreadsheet:
https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/144i9pxDIB_C8ZRZ-6vd9DiPIw8Rt85hTtVoqk7dtHQg/edit?usp=sharing
You can trigger logging by something like this
curl -X POST https://script.google.com/macros/s/AKfycby3EoaQ8DOt8H_Mc4vjH6JZkhsaAwYHk_sa9HE5Be3qVo0Ym0b2/exec?action=test-error

or
curl -X POST https://script.google.com/macros/s/AKfycby3EoaQ8DOt8H_Mc4vjH6JZkhsaAwYHk_sa9HE5Be3qVo0Ym0b2/exec?action=test-log

You can use same log for your custom logging of some intermediate variable during webhook resolution.
The reason I prefer this over standard stackdriver logging is that google sheets are more explicit and easier to manage.
............................................................
You can use console.log() to see things within ""My Executions"".

I am working on a Gradle project where some of the tests occasionally fail sporadically due to reasons unrelated to their correctness (specifically, sometimes the Testcontainers Docker containers fail to start up).This is mitigated using the Test Retry Gradle Plugin to retry tests on failure, which greatly reduces the chances of such a build failure occurring.
plugins {
id 'java'
id 'org.gradle.test-retry' version '1.2.0'
}

dependencies {
testImplementation platform('org.junit:junit-bom:5.7.1')
testImplementation 'org.junit.jupiter:junit-jupiter'
}

test {
useJUnitPlatform()

retry {
maxRetries = 1
}
}

One annoyance with this setup occurs when running individual tests/test classes from the IntelliJ IDEA IDE using the default ""Run tests using: Gradle"" configuration.
When testing code under development from IDEA, failed tests are far more likely to indicate an issue with the in-progress code changes.Flaky test failures are far rarer, since only a small number of tests are being run.Flaky test failures are also obvious when they do occur, and less problematic since it's the result of a manual user interaction.
The downsides of retrying tests are that some of the tests take a while to run, and retrying tests in the IDE gives a false sense of how many tests have passed/failed.For these reasons, I do not want failed tests to be retried when individual tests are run from IDEA.
How can I configure my Gradle project to retry when run from the console, but not from within IntelliJ IDEA?Bonus points if the solution also works for other Java IDEs (e.g. Eclipse & NetBeans), but a solution that only works for IDEA will suffice.
",https://stackoverflow.com/questions/66391484/can-gradle-configuration-vary-based-on-whether-it-is-being-run-from-intellij-ide,"
The idea.active system property can be checked for a value of ""true"", customizing the configuration based on whether it's set:
test {
useJUnitPlatform()

if (System.getProperty('idea.active') != 'true') {
retry {
maxRetries = 1
}
}
}

I'm not sure whether or where this property is documented, but I have confirmed that it works for the latest version of IDEA (IDEA Ultimate 2020.3.2).

For some reason I cannot choose C++ language standard in Visual Studio. By saying that I mean next thing:
I can go to the properties and choose the language standard but Visual Studio doesnt see that. How did I came to that: I tried to include filesystem header with setting the C++17 standard setbut then I saw that filesystem is not a member of std namespace: 
First, I thought that it was not an C++17 standard so I double checked that. After me checking all the stuff again I decided to go to the header file and check the stuff going wrong. I saw that _HAS_CXX17 is disabled although in properties C++17 is set: 
I have no additional libraries connected in properties and this version of Visual studio has to be working with all of that C++17 headers because I had to work with them and still can compile these projects I've been working on, but I can't switch standard on any project now. No library were installed during period it were working last time. I updated Visual studio recently but it didnt help althought on other PC everything is working perfectly.

When changing properties, make sure either that the properties editing window is set to all configurations, or at least matches your current configuration (i. e., if you are on Debug x64, make sure those are the properties you are editing for). But if you want the property to be applied for all configurations, select All configurations on the properties editor.
Snippet showing the properties editor below the configuration selector, in this case they don't match and it'll look like the property changes were ignored

I'm having an issue where my build.sbt file is not being picked up properly using IntelliJ (Ultimate 2020.2.3). I create a new Scala sbt project using the IntelliJ wizard (file > new > project > scala / sbt) and add a new dependancy to the buid.sbt file but when I try to import it into one of my class files, IntelliJ will not compile my project due to a dependancy issue.
The sbt tool window picks up the external dependancies but my project ""external dependancies"" doesn't contain the library at all, even after I refresh the project. Also, my build.sbt file has a bunch of errors in it like it's not being recognised properly by IntelliJ but I've installed the Scala plugin so I don't know what else I could do?
Here you can see that I've added the org.slf4j dependancy into my build.sbt; It's picked up by the sbt tool window (on the right) but not by my project (on the left)

When I hover over the libraryDependencies in the build.sbt file it doesn't seem to recognise the sbt syntax:

I cannot import the library into my class file and the project wont build:

I'm new to Scala and I'm simply trying to create a basic hello world project but I can't seem to get past this frustrating issue.
",https://stackoverflow.com/questions/64637907/scalas-build-sbt-not-recognised-by-intellij,"
You can try first to create an SBT project manually in some directory. build.sbt alone would be enough.
Then run sbt in that directory to see that SBT shell works properly. Try some commands like sbt compile, sbt run with some helloworld app. When you create helloworld app mind the directory structure where you put it, i.e.: src/main/scala/HelloWorld.scala.
If all that works go to IntelliJ and import/open project from there - select build.sbt.
When you create or import SBT project from IntelliJ it takes a while to bootstrap everything and download compiler, etc. Just leave it until it's done. Same goes for first time compilation when the compiler needs to be compiled :).
To setup a sample project you can issue these shell commands:
mkdir untitled
cd untitled/

echo 'name := ""untitled""

version := ""0.1""

scalaVersion := ""2.13.3""

libraryDependencies ++= Seq(
""org.slf4j"" % ""slf4j-simple"" % ""1.7.26"",
)
' > build.sbt

mkdir -p src/main/scala/

echo 'object HelloWorld {
def main(args: Array[String]): Unit = {
println(""Hello World"")
}
}
' > src/main/scala/HelloWorld.scala

sbt run

If there are not issues with these steps then import build.sbt into IntelliJ.
............................................................
I was finally able to get past this issue. I'm not 100% sure what solved it in the end unfortunately but disabling a bunch of plugins I wasn't using seemed to fix the issue for me.
I suspect it may have been the Gradle plugin since I saw some errors in the idea.log file but after re-enabling the Gradle plugin to test everything is still working so not sure.

I am developing a QT GUI for my application using QT Creator (4.11.0).
Recently, our IT updated my OS to Ubuntu 20.04 (from 18.04) - maybe the error is related to that.
I have not touched to project in some month but yesterday wanted to continue developing it.
However, within the IDE there are now thousands of errors highlighted at almost every line of my code. (with highlighted I mean that there is this red background and a red dot beside the line number)
On the very top, it says:
Warning: The code model could not parse an included file, which might lead to incorrect code completion and highlighting, for example.
cstddef:50:10: fatal error: 'stddef.h' file not found
...

The errors that are listed in the IDE are very wired like:
type `QMainWindow`is not a direct or virtual base of `MainWindow` (my class is called `MainWindow`)

I'm pretty sure it is not related to my code:

the code compiles and works fine - it is really just the IDE that is highlighting errors at every line of my code.
I have the same code on a Windows Computer and there no errors are listed in the IDE.
even if I start a brand new QT Widget project the errors appear within the template code provided by the QT Creator.

Since the GCC version changed with the update of the OS, I thought maybe I have to define a new KIT but this also did not help.
Is there anything I can do to fix the issue?
Do I have to reinstall the QT Creator?
I know, pictures are not very well-liked but here I think it might help to understand what I mean with ""IDE is highlighting errors"":

I'm having an issue using Netbeans under Linux, I'm using Arch Linux with KDE and JRE 8 and, as you can see from the screenshot, the GUI fonts are ok, but the source code font rendering is very ugly. I'm using java options for AA, but it only solved the GUI issue, not the source code font rendering issue. I have PHPStorm installed too, to compare, I made a screenshot using the same font and settings in both. PHPStorm fonts are rendered beautifully, Netbeans doesn't, what's the problem?


",https://stackoverflow.com/questions/61964261/netbeans-source-code-font-not-being-well-rendered,"
As I could check, forcing PHPStorm to use the Oracle JDK, what makes font rendering different between Netbeans and PHPStorm is the JRE being used. When I forced PHPStorm to use the Oracle JDK it rendered fonts exactly the same way Netbeans renders. So JetBrains, with it's own JRE, were managed to make a JRE that renders fonts better than OpenJDK or OracleJDK.

It looks like it wasn't able to register (initialize) a package because the ...Modeling.dll is missing or isn't where it's expected to be.
In Windows 10 in a corporate environment, there could also be some permissions issues, especially if an uninstall / reinstall doesn't fix it.
I'd look at the folder structure and see what's there. Are the BPLs and DLLs where they're expected to be? Do you have full admin rights to the folders? Also, do all of the files have full accessibility to everybody or just the Admin user?
You need to run the installer with elevated permissions for Win 10, although the IT Dept can impose stricter limitations than inside of VMs. This can lead to files being installed but not accessible when you launch the program.
(The last place I was at, we had a separate Admin login from our normal login. We'd use it to install stuff. But component libs would sometimes go into ProgramFiles and sometimes into the User's Documents folder. Perms on those two folder trees were handled differently, and the components would be installed as only visible to the Admin and the IDE couldn't load them up. It was quite a PITA.)

Is there a code snippet editor for Intellij Idea 13?

(1 answer)


Closed last year.





Say I have this static method
public static void doSomething () { //do stuff... }

And I need to use it on several different codes I'm writing.
Is there a way to save it in IntelliJ, so that next time I don't need to write it from the beginning but rather choose a shortcut?
Something similar to what it does with the setter and the getter methods, which are automatically written by the IDE itself.
Thanks
",https://stackoverflow.com/questions/66300696/is-it-possible-to-add-own-shortcuts-and-templates-in-intellij,"
To begin with, let's make a simple example, for example, the hello method. Go to Settings -> Editor - > Live Templates. Here you can view ready-made groups of templates and create your own by clicking on the plus sign on the right side of the panel. You can also create a separate template, then it will be added to the user group. After clicking, you will see a window at the bottom where you need to enter an abbreviation, descriptions, and the actual text of the template. There will also be a warning label ""No applicable context"" and a Define button next to it, clicking on which we will see a list of possible contexts — HTML, XML, Java, Javascript, CSS, and so on. Some have sub-items, for example in Java it is possible to use a template in a method, in a comment, at the class level, somewhere else, or everywhere at once. Choose the entire Java package as an example.
As an abbreviation, we will write hello, as a text, here is a line like this:
public static void hello() {
 System.out.println(""Hello"")
}

Click OK, after Apply and you can check. Create a class with any name, write hello inside, press TAB and voila — we have this method

In the legacy Apps Script Editor you could log e from Google Form submissions.

To make sure we are on the same page:
If you are going to run a function like this in any editor you are going to get null:

because simply e is not defined and it is only returning data upon trigger executions of this function. But this function is executed by some events depending on the type of trigger you are using. Therefore, you are not going to see anything (that is not null) in the console if you manually execute this function.
After the function is triggered by specific events:
In any editor again, you can go to the execution page to see the details of the execution. In the new editor, you go to Executions:

and you can see a list of all the executions of this particular function. For example, if your function is a simple onEdit trigger e.g. onEdit(e), you will see this upon editing a cell in the spreadsheet:

You can also see the type of the execution, whether it was executed by the script (Editor) or by a trigger (Simple Trigger).
But anyway, trigger functions are not supposed to be executed manually. As the name suggests, trigger functions are triggered upon events. It wouldn't make sense to use a trigger function and need to manually execute it. It would be a regular function then.

Qt Creator is not parsing the include files in my project properly and gives a lot of errors in the IDE, including errors like main.cpp:14:5: error: unknown type name 'QApplication'.

Quick Question for Visual Studio 2019 Version 16.8.3, How do you connect the work item to the commit in the new git changes tab? I am having a really hard time using this new git experience thing.

it look like you can just use hashtag '#' in commit message,

That is the recommended syntax.
Example:
Fix a bug #1234

That would actually close the work item
See more at ""Drive Git development from a work item""
You can link a work item to commits but also other objects:

The link types you can add within the development section are Branch, Build, Changeset, Commit, Found in build, Integrated in build, Pull Request, and Versioned Item.

In Android Studio 3.6.1. (Java 8) there are multiple options for folding (Code -> Folding):


Collapse - Collapses the code block the cursor is in, if I put it at the start of a method, it only collapses that but not the if, for, whatever else inside.
Collapse Recursively - Collapses the code block the cursor is in but also all the if, for, //... inside.
Collapse All - Works like Collapse Recursively but collapses all the functions in the file, so it's actually a ""Collapse All Rescursively"".


Using the third option in a file with a lot of methods/code blocks, if I just want to work on a single method, means that I have to unfold everything inside that code block again.

I know that Eclipse and Visual Studio are able to fold all methods non-recursively (my shortcuts there are: Ctrl + Shift + Numpad / for folding and Ctrl + Shift + Numpad * for unfolding) but how do I do the same thing in Android Studio?

VSCode on my Macbook Pro is practically unusable due to the intellisense being ungodly slow. This includes:

hovering to find typescript types, inferred and explicit types
autocomplete variables/functions/etc
autocomplete for using shortcuts
error lines shown in editor

For example, I will have an error show. Something like ""variable not defined"" or something simple. But then when I go to rewrite the code, it takes forever for VSCode to catch up. Sometimes I have to let it sit 40-50seconds before it catches up with my changes.
Hovering over typescript types is practically impossible at times and utterly useless. Below is a screenshot of the ""lag"" - changes were made, but it stuck like this for 30+ seconds:

I want to load classes from a module (.jmod) file at runtime into the application memory.
I know that we can easily load classes from a (.jar) file using :-)
ClassLoader loader = URLClassLoader.newInstance(new URL[]{
jarFile.toURL()
});

The total code snippet can be found at this-repo in src omega.deassembler.JarLoader class
But the problem is URLClassLoader is unable to read the modules(.jmod).
So is there any other internal class or library to load classes from a module(.jmod) file.
Actually, I am creating an IDE and this-repo is a part of it for loading content-assist hints.
Earlier, I was using javap command to disassemble and load hints (see omegaide on github).
But this technique consumes much time, so i am writing it again!
Thank You.
",https://stackoverflow.com/questions/66970647/how-to-load-a-class-from-module-jmod-file-at-runtime,"
This is not exactly the answer but a method to make URLClassLoader usable when it has to read modules.
Earlier URLClassLoader was throwing this exception when trying to read a module file(.jmod)
when omitting the module-info
Exception in thread ""main"" java.lang.NoClassDefFoundError: com/sun/javafx/event/DirectEvent (wrong name: classes/com/sun/javafx/event/DirectEvent)
at java.base/java.lang.ClassLoader.defineClass1(Native Method)
at java.base/java.lang.ClassLoader.defineClass(ClassLoader.java:1010)
etc

and when including the meta-info
Exception in thread ""main"" java.lang.NoClassDefFoundError: classes/module-info is not a class because access_flag ACC_MODULE is set


This means that it is unable to identify the directory system inside the jmod file.
So as we know, that a simple jar file contains classes and resources only (Just exclude meta-info).
And in a module file(.jmod), all the classes are placed inside the classes folder and all the resources are placed in the resources folder.
Thus, We can create a temporary jar file say ""modular-jar.jar"" with the contents of classes and resources from the module file,
and then using standard URLClassLoader we can load it onto the classpath
and then can immediately delete the file.
This will just work at least in my case
Here's the code snippet
public static synchronized JarLoader prepareModule(String modulePath){
try{
ZipFile moduleFile = new ZipFile(modulePath);
ZipOutputStream zipOutputStream = new ZipOutputStream(new FileOutputStream(""readable-module-data.jar""));
for(Enumeration enums = moduleFile.entries(); enums.hasMoreElements();){
ZipEntry entry = (ZipEntry)enums.nextElement();
String name = entry.getName();
if((name.startsWith(""classes"") && !name.contains(""module-info"")) || name.startsWith(""resources"")){
 zipOutputStream.putNextEntry(new ZipEntry(name.substring(name.indexOf('/') + 1)));
 InputStream in = moduleFile.getInputStream(entry);
 while(in.available() > 0)
zipOutputStream.write(in.read());
 zipOutputStream.flush();
}
}
zipOutputStream.close();
}
catch(Exception e){
e.printStackTrace();
}
return new JarLoader(""readable-module-data.jar"");

You can order the members by using the Source menu then choosing Organize Members:

The result of organizing members using my settings:
class Token<T> {

private Long offsetStart;

private Long length;

private Boolean fullyResolved;

private Token parentToken;

private Token firstChildToken;

private Token lastChildToken;

private Token previousToken;

private Token nextToken;

private LambdaSetValue<T> lambdaSetValue;

public Token offsetStart(final Long value) {
this.offsetStart = value;
return this;
}

public Token length(final Long value) {
this.length = value;
return this;
}

public Token fullyResolved(final Boolean value) {
this.fullyResolved = value;
return this;
}

public Token parentToken(final Token value) {
this.parentToken = value;
return this;
}

public Token firstChildToken(final Token value) {
this.firstChildToken = value;
return this;
}

public Token lastChildToken(final Token value) {
this.lastChildToken = value;
return this;
}

public Token previousToken(final Token value) {
this.previousToken = value;
return this;
}

public Token nextToken(final Token value) {
this.nextToken = value;
return this;
}

public Token lambdaSetValue(final LambdaSetValue<T> value) {
this.lambdaSetValue = value;
return this;
}

public Long getLength() {
return length;
}

public long getOffsetStart() {
return offsetStart;
}

public void setOffsetStart(long offsetStart) {
this.offsetStart = offsetStart;
}

public void setLength(Long length) {
this.length = length;
}
}

interface LambdaSetValue<T> {
void setValue(T value);
}

As mentioned in my comment, both private Long offsetStart and private Long length have the same access levels and the same type with no functional code difference, and Netbeans does not apply alphabetical order (in English).

I know we can create Live Templates in the settings, and group them, but we would like to have a set of Live Templates on a per project basis.

In VS Code, you can create code-snippets files in the .vscode folder, and those snippets follow the project, so anyone who clones that project will get those project-specific snippets.

Is the any way to put Live Template xml files in the .idea folder and have WebStorm pick them up..?

From today morning, my Visual Studio is behaving very strangely. I get the error ""one or more errors occurred failed to launch debug adapter"" whenever I run the project.

I run my project profile instead of running it in the IIS Express profile. Here is my launchSettings.json file.
{
""iisSettings"": {
""windowsAuthentication"": false,
""anonymousAuthentication"": true,
""iisExpress"": {
""applicationUrl"": ""http://localhost:65498"",
""sslPort"": 44318
}
},
""profiles"": {
""IIS Express"": {
""commandName"": ""IISExpress"",
""launchBrowser"": true,
""environmentVariables"": {

""launchBrowser"": true,
""environmentVariables"": {
""ASPNETCORE_ENVIRONMENT"": ""Development""
},
""applicationUrl"": ""https://localhost:5001;http://localhost:5000""
}
}
}

And when I check the Output window, this is what I get.

The program '[22052] .exe' has exited with code -1
(0xffffffff).

Another thing I noticed is that a new browser tab is opened without any URL in it, just an about:blank page.

I am having this problem too and think it may have something to do with the Edge Browser(or an update?) and the JavaScript Debugger. The first time I run a WebApp, everything works fine.Every time afterwards, I receive the ""failed to launch debug adapter"" shown above.
I have to either disable the Javascript Debugger or Use Internet Explorer to run the app.

............................................................
The issue was that the process that got started from my previous execution was still running. When we start the project using the profile project, it will start a new process, and you can see that there is a new Debug console window as in the preceding image.

You can just close this window and run your project again, and that will fix the issues. You can also enable a setting that will close this process when the debugging stops. To do that, go to Tools and then click on Options, select Debugging and then enable the option Automatically close the console when debugging stops.

If you don't see the option, just click on the other options under the Debugging menu, and wait for the contents to load, and then click on the Debugging menu again. Sometimes it was just showing a blank screen without any options. Seems like a bug in Visual Studio 2019.
Also, make sure to close the browser window that was opened from the last execution. For me it was opened, that is the reason why a new tab with about: blank was opening.
Happy Coding!.
............................................................
We're having the same problem as zBestData above since moving to Visual Studio 2019, Version 16.9.1.
We don't have much time to look into it at the moment but seems to be related to msedge.exe processes left running after a debug session. As a workaround, before starting a second debug session, close all open Edge windows, then kill any msedge.exe instances (eg in Task Manager).
Otherwise, we find we need to Restart the system to clear the fault.
............................................................
The issue is most likely with your browser, which acts as debug adapter in this case. Close all instances of your browser.
Explanation:
As the error message indicates, there is additional information in the output window.
Open the visualstudio-js-debugger.txt file. It should be in a location similar to the one below.
Remember to replace your-user-name in the path below with your correct username.
C:/Users/*your-user-name*/AppData/Local/Temp/visualstudio-js-debugger.txt

The file should look as below, take note of the adapter Id, highlighted in red, it is the Chrome Browser. So you can just close all instances of the Chrome Browser in this case.

I am using Visual studio 2019 for learning C++. Every time I am crating project for each program. Is it possible to crate and run multiple main source file on Visual Studio like Java on Eclipse/Netbeans/IntellijIdea? Thank you.
",https://stackoverflow.com/questions/62347264/can-i-use-multiple-main-function-under-a-project-on-visual-studio-2019,"
The short answer ""You can't and you can"".

main() is called an entry point. In Java you can have main() in every class because each class can be self-contained in theory.

C++ doesn't work like this because at the end every thing get linked to a single executable.

If you want to have multiple entry points You need to:


Create seperate *.cpp file for every entry point, each file should define its own main() function.
Each file should have a separate binary target in your build system(Cmake...etc)
Build & Run target as needed.

............................................................
There is two ways of doing it. Either you use cmake, more info here

or

you put the main functions in separate namespaces and then define, which one do you want to run. example here

",https://stackoverflow.com/questions/61503049/scanf-executed-before-printf-in-eclipse,"
Usually stdout is set to line buffered. Apparently one of your IDEs sets it to fully buffered.

You can force prints to dump the associated buffer with fflush(), eg

printf(""hello ""); // works in unbuffered stream
printf(""world!\n""); // works in line buffered stream
fflush(stdout); // works in fully buffered stream

I am working with C++ code with ROS2. ROS2 has code style standards and one of the recommended linters is ament_cpplint, which is slightly different from cpplint
Most IDEs/Editors for C++ (Clion, Atom, VS Code, Sublime Text) have plugins for cpplint which will run periodic linter checks as you are editing files. You usually have to set the path to the cpplint executable on your computer. I've tried to set the path to ament_cpplint executable instead but it just won't work. I've tried this with multiple IDEs and plugins by now and none of them will work.
I am not sure what's causing this, Google's cpplint works with IDEs. And I can run $ ament_cpplintfrom the command line just fine, but I can't get it to work in an IDE.
",https://stackoverflow.com/questions/63343297/why-cant-i-use-ament-cpplint-with-cpplint-plugins-for-various-ides,"
This might be too late for you, but for others.
You need to pass the path to the cpplint.py executable that is inside the ament_cpplint package.

When you write code in Jupyter cells, the notebook (.ipynb) is converted into a JSON object, making it very difficult to work in an IDE.
The solution my company landed on is writing everything in external python modules and importing them into the notebook.We use Jupyter widgets extensively and they can be imported into .py files as easily as importing them into notebooks.In the end, we get a library of custom widgets and modules that can be used by everyone, and since it's just python, we can build/edit in any IDE.I use Sublime.
There may be other ways, but this approach works so well for us that we've stopped looking for alternatives.

I've decided to use eclipse as my primary IDE for c++ coding but I can't seem to figure out the automatic autocomplete. When I press ctrl + space it shows them just fine but not when I'm typing normally. I tried browsing through the settings but in content assist setting under auto-activation it only has checkboxes for ., ::, and -> triggers and not for letters, numbers and parentheses. I tried browsing around the web and all the solutions were for the java version of the eclipse IDE, not the c++ one.
",https://stackoverflow.com/questions/62955495/how-can-i-enable-automatic-code-suggestions-in-eclipse-for-c,"
I do not think it is possible with the C++ editor. As you described, automatic trigger for content assist only works after typing ., -> or :: (if enabled) and there is no way to make it work for other combinations. See the dialog below:

As you mentioned, Ctrl + Space can always be used to manually launch the tool, but I understand it can become annoying.
So to answer your question: No, it is not possible (for C++).

It's very easy to end up with more than one file called ""data.csv"", so you can end up with your IDE using a different file to the file used on a prompt.
One way round this is to give the full path for any file you open.
You can also check where the debugger in your IDE is running - there will be an option for the current working directory.

Sam McCall over on the LLVM discord also had this to say

You can get a bit more info by adding -log=verbose to the clangd args, and providing more of the log (things that might be relevant include version, path, preamble build, ...).
I don't know much about windows stdafx, but I understand it pulls in a lot of stuff, some of which may have tickled a bug in that version.

The problem was Spring-Tool itself which had a bug where it didn't show any kind of error. There are two ways to get around the problem: delete the project from Spring-boot, delete the Workspace and reload everything. In case it is also recommended to download Spring-boot tool Suite again. In the second case it could be an error importing the project, try to import it to Intellij or another IDEE and see if you have the same problems. If you have the same problems it is a problem of loading the java libraries. To solve it you should open another project where you have no problems and once opened, go to FILE-> NEW-> IMPORT PROJECT and import your project.

I have to develop an iOS app for college project. On my Mac the Xcode command line tool is installed. I dont want to use the Xcode GUI as it performs very laggy.

""I dont want to use the Xcode GUI as it performs very laggy.""

Not necessarily true.

First, there is a big difference between Xcode GUI and Xcode IDE

If you don't like the GUI portion for UI development - i.e. using Storyboard / Interface Builder - you don't have to use that feature at all.

If you don't like the IDE as a whole (code-completion, formatting, integrated help, build-run-debug, etc, etc) you don't have to use that either.

For example, you can write your entire app with TextEdit and build it from the command line... if you really wanted to.

However, you do have to have the SDK installed, and the best way of doing that (probably the only practical way) is to install Xcode ... but again, you can use any text/code editor you like, and then use the command-line tools for building.
............................................................
yes you need to, everything that you need to make an app is on the XCode IDE.

You can't directly run Linux shell scripts on Windows. You do have a few options, however:


Run your script through Cygwin
Run your script in mintty (this is the shell included with Git for Windows, is called Git Bash in the context menu)
Run your script under WSL (Windows Subsystem for Linux)
Port the script to another language you can run on Windows




For 1 and 2, it'll be on you to make sure any dependencies for the script are available in either Cygwin or mintty.

For 3, after making sure WSL is set up you can run a single command under WSL: wsl script.sh arg1 arg2 argX.

I would recommend option 3 or 4. 3 may offer the best experience in terms of compatibility and ease of set up (without porting the script) as Cygwin and mintty can be a pain to set up dependencies in. Option 4 would be best though as long as you are well-versed in both PowerShell and shell scripts and can transpose the equivalent calls from one to the other.

It is basically this issue.
While using code like

I can't use search usages properly, because it obviously finds the export line.
It can be hacked in functional components like this:
const SomeComponent = withRouter((props) => {
 //...component here
});
export default SomeComponent;

but gets very ugly when using redux for example:
const mapStateToProps = (state, ownProps) => ({
....
});

const SomeComponent = connect(mapStateToProps)({
cartPhotos,
digitals,
balancePrice,
photolabPrice,
digitalsPrice,
voucher,
photosPrice,
deliveryPrice,
totalPrice,
openPhotolabModal,
isSidebar,
}) => {

});
export default SomeComponent;

Is there a way to overcome this without using such ugly approach?

No, this feature has not been implemented yet and there is no way to do this.
............................................................
If working in PyCharm is not a neccesity, you could work in a jupyter notebook: https://jupyter.org/ 
You could load your data in a cell and work with it in the next cells. Once executed, the result of a cell is kept in memory.

I've found a dirty trick - I am aware this is a very, very non-pythonic and not appropriate way of doing this. But it does the trick for me in this example. Again this code is only temporarily used for testing and will be removed once I'm happy with the code.

Module I run is as follow:

data = pd.read_excel(path, index_col=0) #Data is loaded only once

while True:
reload(TestModule)
TestModule.test_function(data)
input(""Press Enter to rerun the test"")


Now in TestModule I have test_function where I can reload ModyfiedModule I am working on and any function I want to test.

TestModule:

def test_function(data):
from ModyfiedModule import MyClass

#Run bunch of tests from MyClass
#Code to test MyClass is here


In this case, I load data only once and I can modify MyClass module and perform various test defined in TestModule without need to reload data each time.

The only thing I need to do after modifying code is to save MyClass and TestModule and press Enter in the console to rerun the test.

Up until recently I could select the startup project (equivalent to right-clicking on the project in the solution explorer and choosing ""Set as Startup Project"") from the Standard toolbar with the ""Select Startup Item"" drop-down.Now it's gone, yet the item is still checked under ""Add or Remove Buttons"".

The closest reference I could find is this, but the solution doesn't match my situation because I have more than one project and this is happening no matter which solution is loaded.

Please help me figure out what is going on.


",https://stackoverflow.com/questions/60058210/select-startup-item-command-drop-down-not-showing-on-standard-toolbar-in-vis,"
I had a similar issue where the start menu item (called ""Debug Target"") was completely gone. Toggling the menu item on and off did not resolve the issue. I selected ""Reset Toolbar"" at the bottom of the menu and that resolved the problem for me. May require some manual set up after if your menu is heavily customized. But if you use the Standard layout it shouldn't be an issue.

............................................................
I had the same problem. The ""Startup Projects"" drop-down disappeared occasionally. It was probably caused by installing/uninstallin/updating VS extensions.
The solution was easy. Install free extension Clear MEF Component Cache. Then simply click the Clear MEF Component Cache in the Tools menu. The toolbar should be repaired after restating Visual Studio.
This solution does NOT reset any of your UI customizations.

When I click into the VS Code v1.71.2 file explorer, press ctrl+F to open the file explorer search option, and type the name of the file I want to search for, VSCODE only pulls up some of the matches, but not nearly all of them. In fact, it only seems to randomly reveal file matches that I've recently opened or opened the parent folder of. What's with this random behavior? I tried closing and re-opening vscode to no avail. I still only get a couple matches out of 50 files with that name:

I really like PyCharm's SQL inspections, they are really useful and give valuable insights. But they don't work well with psycopg2 SQL composition features. I'm building a simple query to perform multiple rows insert:
from psycopg2.sql import SQL, Placeholder, Literal

def build_materials_insert(model_id, materials):
data = SQL("", "").join(
SQL(""({model_id}, {obj_name}, {material})"").format(
model_id=Literal(model_id),
obj_name=Literal(mat[""object""]),
material=Literal(mat[""material""])
) for mat in materials
)

return SQL(""INSERT INTO materials(model_id, object, material)VALUES {values}"").format(values=data)

And after the inspection, PyCharm shows the warning '(' expected, got '{'. It's valid from SQL standpoint, but not useful here, as this text in curly braces is just a format placeholder.
Using Alt-Enter to show suggestion offers just ""Change SQL dialect"" feature.
I can disable SQL syntax inspection in general, but I don't want to do that, as in other places it's pretty useful. I tried to find an appropriate disable comment command, but didn't find the list for the built-in SQL.
Is there some way to disable SQL validation for a particular statement, as I really like to keep my code with all green inspections result?
",https://stackoverflow.com/questions/66175647/disable-pycharm-sql-inspection-for-one-statement,"

I have removed the telemetry consent but the window with the telescope on which ""your project is currently empty"" is still there.
How can I disable it?
Is there any package which removes it?
",https://stackoverflow.com/questions/65860547/atom-how-to-disable-the-telescope-project-section-your-project-is-currently,"
The panel with the telescope and the phrase ""Your project is currently empty"" is shown not by Atom itself, but by a package ""tree-view"". This issue is supposed to be fixed in version ""v0.229.0"" of the package. Meanwhile, you can just disable the package to get rid of the panel:

Open preferences: Edit > Preferences (Linux), Atom > Preferences (macOS), or File > Settings (Windows).
Select ""Packages"".
Search for ""tree-view""
Click ""Disable""

............................................................
You can collapse the whole tree-view panel by: hover you cursor over the inner edge of the panel and a semi-circle with left arrow will appear in the middle; click that.
If you just want a blank tree-view panel instead (hide the graphic & buttons), you can add this to your stylesheet:
#add-projects-view {
display: none !important;

I am confused as to how to get into script mode in Python's standard IDLE. I surprisingly cannot find how to get into it on Google.
",https://stackoverflow.com/questions/66863444/how-do-i-get-into-script-mode-for-python,"
I believe you mean the simple editor that ships with Python, ""IDLE""?
If you have an IDLE console window open already, go to file->New File, or press ctrl+N to get a window where you can write and save a python file like a text editor.
When you've written a script in that editor you can save it as you'd expect from File->Save and run it from Run->Run Module, or press F5 as a quick shortcut. It should then output any text to the IDLE console window.
Also see the comments directly beneath your question for some resources :) Happy scripting!

Is there way, in Atom, to open files that are mentioned in comments?
When I edit a code file, there are often other code files of interest that I may want to also open while working on that file. Sometimes these reference files are miles away and require numerous steps of navigation to open them via the left-pane tree structure.
I was thinking, it would be nice if I could put relative file paths into javascript comments in a manner that atom would understand that if I click that path it should open that file in a new tab.
I suspect this isn't an original idea, so I'm hoping someone can direct me to a solution that enables this type of functionality or make me aware of how it is already enabled but I must use some syntax I'm not currently using.
",https://stackoverflow.com/questions/62904939/atom-io-open-files-via-clickable-links-within-javascript-comments,"
I found open-project-file and it seems like a nice fit.
Update: I tested it and it works great! You just click on the relative path (whether it is located in code or comment) and by hitting ctrl-shift-o it immediately opens the file in a new tab within the atom editor.

I can't get monodevelop to work on Manjaro. I tried all the different options to install in AUR (monodevelop-beta, monodevelop-bin, monodevelop-git, monodevelop-nuget3, monodevelop-stable) and most of them failed to build.

The only one that didn't fail was monodevlop-bin, but I couldn't get it to build my program. At first I got this error:

The imported project ""/usr/lib/mono/msbuild/15.0/bin/Roslyn/Microsoft.CSharp.Core.targets"" was not found.
Confirm that the path in the <Import> declaration is correct, and that the file exists on disk. (MSB4019)


There was no folder ""Roslyn"" in the specified location. I made a folder with that name and copied the file Microsoft.CSharp.targets from msbuild/15.0/bin/ in the ""Roslyn"" folder (renamed the copy to Microsoft.CSharp.Core.targets). 

It probably wasn't a good idea, but I tried it, just in case.

That did seemed to work, but then I got another error:

Since the issues with compatibility with the latest version of mono and msbuild as well as 
there no longer being a ""stable"" build mode on the github project I am disowning this project.

Sadly I stopped using this IDE in favor of VSCode a while ago and also no longer have the time to maintain it with the large number of incompatibilities with the various dependencies.

Hopefully someone with more time will take over..


This is from the original maintainter/builder (at the time of writing) in the comments of the AUR page. After him, it seems that another person tried to continue maintaining it, but he still failed:


coder2000 commented on 2020-03-31 18:51 

The build process is currently broken and the documentation is incomplete.


So, for now, you can't use monodevelop on Arch based systems (at least from AUR). You will have to use alternative IDEs, like JetBrains Rider, or text editors (with proper extensions), like VSCode or Atom. 

Also, from personal experience, I would advice against using Arch based distributions for programming, because of problems like that. Use Ubuntu or something Ubuntu based for easiest experience with programming tools (I use Linux Mint for programming and I haven't had any major problems).

This is a general question with a specific example.

How do people getting into scala and using it for big projects handle unreliability of tools/IDE? Do you just accept red markings all over your source code?

I encounter yet another scala codebase where working code is flagged red by idea Cannot resolve symbol Repr.

I start a playground project to explore one of libraries in the codebase - shapeless (as I understand it a highly regarded library in scala community).

I write extremely basic code from the first page of official shapeless guide.

package example
import shapeless._

object Hello extends App {
val genericEmployee = Generic[Employee].to(Employee(""Dave"", isOld = true))
val genericIceCream = Generic[IceCream].to(IceCream(""yellow"", isInCone = false))

def genericCsv (gen: String :: Boolean :: HNil) :List[String] = List(gen(0), gen(1).toString())

println(genericCsv(genericIceCream).toString())
}

case class Employee (name: String, isOld: Boolean)

case class IceCream (name: String, isInCone: Boolean)


gen(0) and gen(1) are flagged with No implicits found for parameter at hlist.At[String :: Boolean :: HNil, Nat#N]

The code works.

I also remember errors-but-not-real-errors being caused by Akka HTTP.

There seems to be a fundamental difficulty in IntelliJ supporting libraries relying on macros such as shapeless

@niktrop


Shapeless is heavily using macros. We have no way to support them
generically.


@joroKr21 


there is a fundamental barrier for whitebox macros. You have to run a
complete typecheck and expand them just to see what type they return
and this is not feasible to do on every keystroke. Blackbox macros on
the other hand shouldn't pose such problems.


@olafurpg 


scala-compiler and intellij-scala are different typecheckers,
scala-reflect macros are currently implemented against scala-compiler
APIs which makes them difficult to support in alternative scala
compilers.

I am using a custom script to format my code. Currently, whenever I want to format, I have to call Tasks: Run Task and then choose my format task.

I haven't tested it with an actual formatter but you can call tasks from keybindings.try

""command"": ""-editor.action.formatDocument"",

I used the default Format Document keybinding but you could use whatever keybinding you wish.

Is it possible to install flutter on VS 2019 IDE (not Visual Studio Code or Android Studio/IntelliJ)?

I can't find anything for VS 2019, but only for VS Code.
",https://stackoverflow.com/questions/59590357/is-it-possible-to-setup-in-visual-studio-or-other-ides,"
From the Flutter FAQ:

Does Flutter work with any editors or IDEs?
We support plugins for Android Studio, IntelliJ IDEA, and VS Code.
See editor configuration for setup details, and Android Studio/IntelliJ and VS Code for tips on how to use the plugins.
Alternatively, you can use a combination of the flutter command in a terminal and one of the many editors that support editing Dart.

So, no
You cannot get the same tooling in Visual Studio that you can get in Android Studio/IntelliJ and VS Code because the Flutter team does not work on support for any other IDEs.
If you visit IDEs and editors for Dart, you can see what code editors have support for editing Dart code and you can use that in conjunction with the flutter command to get a similar experience.

I have recently experienced problems with PyCharm with this build info:

The problem with the emulator is that you cannot type into emulator console when using user input. The python script itself works when you turn off console emulation a run your script in python console instead. But running through emulator would be more comfortable for me as for others. The error you receive is this one:

Zadej pozici: Traceback (most recent call last):
File ""C:/Users/Adam/Desktop/Engeto/python/STUFF/1D_piskvorky/1D_pisk.py"", line 79, in 
piskvorky_1d()
File ""C:/Users/Adam/Desktop/Engeto/python/STUFF/1D_piskvorky/1D_pisk.py"", line 70, in piskvorky_1d
hrac_vstup= int(input(""Zadej pozici: ""))
ValueError: invalid literal for int() with base 10: ''

Which means that python received an empty value for int() I suppose, but when you try to type some characters instead of a number:

ValueError: invalid literal for int() with base 10: 'ssss'

The emulator sees that you type characters instead of numbers. Please let me know if someone came across this problem and what was a solution for you, maybe this could help others with finding a solution.
",https://stackoverflow.com/questions/60041000/pycharm-problem-with-console-emulator-cannot-type-into-emulated-console,"
Your claim that you cannot type into the emulated console is incorrect.You entered strings that are not valid arguments for input.The error messages are correct.They are the same as when one enters the same directly into interactive python.

>>> s = int(input('Enter number: '))
Enter number: xxxx

ValueError: invalid literal for int() with base 10: 'xxxx'


They are also the same as when one runs the same code from a file.input returns a string.Reread the part of the int doc about string arguments.

If x is not a number or if base is given, then x must be a string,
bytes, or bytearray instance representing an integer literal in the
given base.The literal can be preceded by '+' or '-' and be surrounded
by whitespace.The base defaults to 10.Valid bases are 0 and 2-36.
Base 0 means to interpret the base from the string as an integer literal.
>>> int('0b100', base=0)

Neither '' nor 'ssss' represent string literals in base 10.

The place where the error is taking place is in the encrypt-method where you generate the initialization vector (necessary for AES CTR mode). The iv is placed at the beginning of the encrypted string/byte array in bytearray[0]. Just change the line from 

bytearray[0] = ctrTxt.toString().getBytes();


to

bytearray[0] = ctrTxt.toString().getBytes(StandardCharsets.ISO_8859_1);


and your program is working within your IDE or on command line.

I am encountering problems while coding Django using Pycharm...
As you could see from the picture, for unknown reasons my Python file were recognised as text files... Even if there are coloring, the auto-fill for my code is definitely different from writting in other Python files.
Here is the screenshot:

Pretty much appreciate it!
",https://stackoverflow.com/questions/63265056/views-py-files-not-recognised-as-python-files-in-pycharm,"
Resetting config is too radical. views.py was associated with a wrong file type (text?) in Settings | Editor | File Types

............................................................
I had the same problem, mine was listed in Settings | Editor | File Types | Auto-detect file type by content. Once I removed it from there, pycharm was once again working like a charm.
............................................................
1. Method:
Refresh Pycharm or Quit and open Pycharm again (restart Pycharm)
2. Method:
Wait for a minute, if there are a loading bar in bottom of Pycharm window
3. Method:
Reinstall Pycharm if both are not working
Happy coding!

I am using Visual Studio 2019. I cannot seem to find any option to make UML Class Diagram and generate code from it. The language which I'm working on is C#. If there is a way to do it, kindly tell me which libraries and frameworks are required in Visual Studio. You can also recommend another IDE if it does the job with a little briefing. Thank you.

You can change color and set any color from this path :

This way, one can highlight the text, as he wish. I would like to know, is there any similar mechanism in Visual Studio Code editor, so that I can manually highlight the text even if its not done automatically.
Thanks.
",https://stackoverflow.com/questions/66099893/is-it-possible-to-apply-syntax-highlighting-of-one-filetype-to-another-in-visual,"
You can change the Language used for a particular instance by clicking on the Language ID field in the Status bar and select the new language from the list.
This executes the command workbench.action.editor.changeLanguageMode or Change Language Mode from the Command palette.
To do a permanent Language ID selection based on the file extension define a setting
""files.associations"": {
""*.myext"": ""html"",
""*.myfoo"": ""css""
}

I am new to C language but I use Gitpod for other languages. I would like to know how to run this simple ""hello world"" main.c program from the Gitpod interface step by step?
#include <studio.h>
void main(){
printf(""hello"")
}

Many thanks !
",https://stackoverflow.com/questions/65778284/gitpod-to-run-a-c-hello-world-program,"
After fixing the errors you can compile the code with gcc main.c and run the binary a.out.
Errors as already mentioned:

studio.h -> stdio.h
...hello"") -> ...hello"");

............................................................
after the printf(""hello"")
you should put ;
//like this
printf(""hello"");

............................................................
#include <stdio.h>
int main(){
printf(""hello"");

I am using Spyder to write scientific Python code but do not know if the following question is really a Spyder question or an IPython one...
If I create a variable (I have simple type in mind, like doubles, ndarrays and so on), its value is not shown just after creation.
So for example if I do
s = x1 + x2

I would like to see (or having the possibility of choosing whether I want to see it or not) the value of the newly created s.
With these settings, I would need to type
s

just after assignment to see the result.
FYI, the behavoir I am looking for is achieved in the Matlab console through the presence or not of a ;
Just to be clear: I am asking this question to save typing s (but sometimes the name is longer) and an Enter stroke. So you can call me lazy if you like.
",https://stackoverflow.com/questions/66762070/ipython-spyder-do-not-show-output-of-the-assignment-of-a-variable,"
This is not how Python works; assignments do not have values.
There is a hidden config option in IPython/Spyder to do that but only with the last assignment of a cell.
In [1]: %config InteractiveShell.ast_node_interactivity='last_expr_or_assign'

In [2]: a = 1+1
Out[2]: 2

you can set it as well in your IPython configuration file, and the values this can take are ['all', 'last', 'last_expr', 'none', 'last_expr_or_assign']
from ipython --help-all
--InteractiveShell.ast_node_interactivity=<Enum>
'all', 'last', 'last_expr' or 'none', 'last_expr_or_assign' specifying which
nodes should be run interactively (displaying output from expressions).
Choices: any of ['all', 'last', 'last_expr', 'none', 'last_expr_or_assign']
Default: 'last_expr'

This might not work in all cases, like tuple assignment, unpacking and co, feel free to open bug reports if you encounter those case.
I would also warn you that the internal way this work in IPython is really tricky so it may have unintended consequences.

Before today, I was able to use the quick fix option to generate methods on a class that implements a given interface. I would simply begin the class definition; something like:
export default class MyService extends BaseService implements IMyService {

}


Then I would hover over the class name (i.e. MyService).
There would be a red squiggly line under the class name, because the members of the interface (i.e. IMyService) had not been implemented. After hovering a moment, the quick fix menu would pop-up and I could select an option to generate the members.
Today, everything is working as before, except when the quick fix menu pops-up it states: No quick fixes available, even though it states the members that should be added to the class to correct the error.

I've disable all my plug-ins and have restarted the application, but the issue persists.
The interface I'm currently working with is composed of 4 required methods. The base class my class is extending has no conflicting members with the interface, and the problem persists when I remove the extends clause.
How can I fix this? Is there something I'm doing to cause this?
",https://stackoverflow.com/questions/62706704/vs-code-no-quick-fix-for-generating-typescript-interface-methods,"

The problem was, my interface required the Request and Response modules from the express package. Once I imported them into the class file I was able to use the quick fix.

I am using PyQt5 in PyCharm Community Edition. I have installed qt5-serialport as described in this question and when I use python on the command line I am able to do from PyQt5.QtSerialPort import QSerialPort and use the QSerialPort module with no problem in the interactive python environment and when running a python script that makes use of the QSerialPort module, so it's clear that python itself is finding the module just fine. However in PyCharm, the module is not found despite the fact that I'm using the system python as the interpreter. On the line from PyQt5.QtSerialPort import QSerialPort PyCharm underlines QSerialPort in red and it doesn't offer any tooltip suggestions for methods etc. on any QSerialPort object I instantiate.
Normally when I get this kind of problem I install the package using the installer within PyCharm but this particular package doesn't seem to be in any public repo listing I can find. (Somehow yay found it, despite it not being listed in the searchable AUR). Other modules in the PyQt5 package import in PyCharm without problems. How can I get PyCharm Community Edition to recognize this module?
",https://stackoverflow.com/questions/65000614/pycharm-finds-library-but-not-module,"
Installing it on the terminal should work using pip from python.org.
pip install PyQt5

This approach appears to work since it has the core features for finding, downloading, and installing packages from various Python package indexes. More info on pip from python.org.
According to the Troubleshooting tips from JetBrains listed for PyCharm, there is useful info on debugging import errors using PyQt. So this may be the cause as to why installation through the IDE was not working even though PyQt was installed on the interpreter.

How can I get my include files to show in my CodeLite project. It shows my src files perfectly fine, but the include folder is empty.

The usual way to also include header files in a project is to also list them in the add_executable command.

Perhaps something like

set(SOURCES src/Entity.cpp 
src/Scene.cpp)

set(HEADERS include/Entity.hpp 
include/Scene.hpp)

add_executable(${EXECUTABLE_NAME} ${SOURCES} ${HEADERS})

An open-source project I contribute to uses banner style (also called Ratliff style). It looks like that:

 // In C
 for (i = 0; i < 10; i++) {
 if (i % 2 == 0) {
 doSomething(i);
 }
 else {
 doSomethingElse(i);
 }
 }


Some IDE's like QtCreator have their own configurations for formatting, but others, like Visual Studio Code, require a .clang-format file.

I looked online for existing configurations, and couldn't find any. Then I tried to make one from scratch using this clang-format generator, but I couldn't manage to indent the braces right.

So, is it possible to create a clang-format file for Ratliff/Banner style, or is there some missing configuration that will force us to use some other generator?
",https://stackoverflow.com/questions/60470702/clang-format-for-banner-style,"
This answer is not going to be the ""answer"" that you were looking for, but it is what I've discovered over the last two days of digging through the code for clang-format. I, too, have been looking for a way to auto-format a variant of banner style with clang-format.

clang-format seems to be missing some capabilities that would enable it to auto-format banner style.

For instance, you need to indent ending (right) braces for code blocks. clang-format does not even appear to track ending braces, but it does track starting (left) braces within its internals.

I started out my studying streak thinking I could understand the way clang-format implements its formatter system, so I could add the features needed to do it. Sadly it was way too complicated for me.

Perhaps someday we will be able to auto-format banner style with clang-format, but not today.

If someone out there knows this answer is inaccurate, please don't hesitate to correct me.

edit: Instead of giving you just a verification of what can't be done with clang-format, perhaps you might find http://astyle.sourceforge.net useful.

I have a led-matrix that is common anode in row-wise and common cathode in column-wise.

 }

I need the first row and the last row and first column and last column led glow together so that it forms the shape of a square but I was able to glow them separately only first row and last row together and first column and lastcolumn.
",https://stackoverflow.com/questions/58521030/is-there-a-possibility-to-glow-the-led-in-55-matrix-in-a-square-shape-with-the,"
In your specific case you could switch on the first and last row for e.g. 1msec then switch on the first and last column for 1msec and repeat this. I further suggest to switch off all LEDs before switching on a new pattern.

void loop() { 
static int show_rows = 0;

switch_all_off();
if(show_rows) {
first_last_row();
} else {
first_last_column();
}
show_rows = !show_rows;
delay(10);
}

void switch_all_off()
{
int off = 0;
for( j = 0 ; j < Loop_Count ; j++ )
{
digitalWrite(Led_Row_Pins[i],off);
digitalWrite(Led_Column_Pins[j],!off);
}
}



With this first step the LEDs that are contained both in the rows and in the columns will be brighter. To fix this you can exclude the corner LEDs either from the rows or from the columns, e.g.

void first_last_column()
{

for( j = 0 ; j < Loop_Count ; j++ )// Led First And Last Column
{
for( i = 0 ; i < Loop_Count ; i++)
{
if((i != 0) && (i != 4) && ( j == 0 || j == 4 ))
{
digitalWrite(Led_Row_Pins[i],state);//Led_On_State
digitalWrite(Led_Column_Pins[j],!state);
}
}
}
}


For a more general solution you have to loop over the rows, activate one row after the other and switch the column pins as necessary for the current row.

#define MAXLEDS 5
int states[MAXLEDS][MAXLEDS] = {
{ 1, 0, 0, 0, 1 },
{ 0, 1, 0, 1, 0 },
{ 0, 0, 1, 0, 0 },
{ 0, 1, 0, 1, 0 },
{ 1, 0, 0, 0, 1 }
};

void switch_leds(int row) {
int i;

/* switch off all rows */
for(i = 0; i < MAXLEDS, i++) {
digitalWrite(Led_Row_Pins[i], 0);
}

/* switch columns according to current row */
for(i = 0; i < MAXLEDS; i++) {
digitalWrite(Led_Column_Pins[i], !states[row][i]);
}

/* switch on current row */
digitalWrite(Led_Row_Pins[row], 1);

}

void loop() { 
static int row = 0;
/* switch on LEDs in a single row */
switch_leds(row);
/* next row */
row++; row %= MAXLEDS;
/* The processing delay between calls to loop() is added to this delay. */
delay(5);
}

I'm fairly new to C but writing a small multithreaded application.I want to introduce a delay to a thread.I'd been using 'usleep' and the behavior is what I desire - but it generates warnings in C99.


implicit declaration of function ‘usleep’


It's only a warning, but it bothers me.I've Googled for an answer but all I could find was a while-loop / timer approach that seemed like it would be CPU intensive.

EDIT:

My includes are:

#include <stdio.h>
#include <stdlib.h>
#include <pthread.h>
#include <unistd.h>
#include <time.h>


And I'm invoking the compiler with:

c99 program.c -Wall -pedantic -W -lpthread


EDIT #2:

I've created a new file that contains:

#include <unistd.h>

int main(void) {
usleep(10);
}


And I still get the warning.

EDIT #3:
As suggested, I've updated the text of the question.
",https://stackoverflow.com/questions/7546252/what-can-i-use-besides-usleep-in-a-modern-posix-environment,"
The problem is that you are using a standard C99 compiler, but you're trying to access POSIX extensions. To expose the POSIX extensions you should for example define _POSIX_C_SOURCE to 200809L (for the current standard). For example this program:

#include <time.h>

int main(void) {
struct timespec reqtime;
reqtime.tv_sec = 1;
reqtime.tv_nsec = 500000000;
nanosleep(&reqtime, NULL);
}


will compile correctly and wait for 1.5 seconds (1 second + 500000000 nanoseconds) with the following compilation command:

c99 main.c -D _POSIX_C_SOURCE=200809L


The _POSIX_C_SOURCE macro must be defined with an appropriate value for the POSIX extensions to be available.

Also the options -Wall, -pedantic and -W are not defined for the POSIX c99 command, those look more like gcc commands to me (if they work on your system then that's fine, just be aware that they are not portable to other POSIX systems).
............................................................
You are probably on a modern POSIX system:


POSIX.1-2008removesthespecificationof usleep().


On my system (linux) there is a detailed explanation of the macros that must be set to get that function back. But you should just follow the advice that zvrba already gave, use nanosleep instead.
............................................................
From the manual page: This function is obsolete. Use nanosleep instead.
............................................................

implicit declaration of function ‘usleep’


This warning usually means that you didn't #include the right header file, in this case unistd.h.
............................................................
Did you have the #include <unistd.h> ?. 

And you can use some of the similar methods instead: nanosleep() for nanoseconds and sleep() for seconds. Or another way could be using clock(), but i think this is more CPU wasting.

I can't manege to get the images or icons loaded. When I run the app in VScode the app works, just without the images. The Icons even have the space but there is nothing in the space where the icon is supposed to be. But running it in the Command Terminal works like it is supposed to.
Using the 'os.path. ...' method, and running it in VScode works every time. But why is it like that?
And, how will the os.path method affect the app when I run it alone? I.e. when I don't run it though the IDE or the Command Prompt (I'm planing to make it a stand alone app, just for fun).
A sample of code that works, the whole app is a bit bigger. (but same principles):
import sys
import os

from PyQt5.QtGui import QPixmap
from PyQt5.QtWidgets import QApplication, QLabel, QMainWindow


class MainWindow(QMainWindow):
 def __init__(self):
super().__init__()

self.setWindowTitle(""My App"")

current_directory = os.path.dirname(os.path.realpath(__file__))


widget = QLabel("""")
image = QPixmap(os.path.join(current_directory, ""39487.jpg"" ))
widget.setPixmap(image)
widget.setScaledContents(True)

self.setCentralWidget(widget)


app = QApplication(sys.argv)

window = MainWindow()
window.show()

app.exec_()

Now why when i run this code, the images show. Yet when I remove the os.path method it does not work in the IDE. Running the second version in the Prompt does work though.
Why does the IDE load the code different than the Prompt?

The relative paths in python with respect to where the python command is executed, by default VScode launches python in the root folder of the project so it is not necessarily launched in the script folder, instead you use the command promt from the folder where There is the script and the icons, if you were to run from a higher folder you would also have the same problem. Due to the error that causes relative paths it is better to use absolute paths either explicitly or by constructing it using os.path.

I can understand the intention is to not occupy much visible area in the text editor when the list contains long member names but that logic is absurd because the list width will be sized to its maximum width if you want to pick that long member name, so... totally useless and annoying for me.

Disable suggestions list auto-resize on Visual Studio 2019?


I am afraid that you cannot get what you want in this issue so far. And VS IDE does not have such option to control it so far.

The purpose of the automatic adjustment of the scroll box is to facilitate the user to visually see the full name of the method and then confirm and use it. It is from the perspective of the convenience of developing code.

According to your needs, you need a better visual experience and the best suggestion is to add an option on VS IDE to force maintain the size.So we recommend that you could suggest your feature on our User Voice Forum



In addition, when you finish writing such feature, you can share the link here with us and anyone who is interested in this will vote for you so that it will get more attention from Microsoft.

In Visual Studio Code, Ctrl+f activates the Find widget. I use vscode on Windows 10 (ssh into 'nix) and separately on the Ubuntu 18.04 Linux distro (w/Gnome Shell), when using the integrated terminal. I expected Ctrl+f to step one character forward in the CLI, as is typical on many Linux terminals, within vscode. How do I accomplish this?

Type Ctrl+f in the Keyboard Shortcuts search bar and find the ""Terminal: Focus Find Widget"" line. Mine looks like this:
Click the pencil icon to alter the keybinding. One available for me was Ctrl+Alt+f.

Note: the following is pasted from the docs for easy reference.
Or, in your keybindings.json change:
{ ""key"": ""ctrl+f"", ""command"": ""-workbench.action.terminal.focusFindWidget"",
""when"": ""terminalFocus"" },

to something like this:
{ ""key"": ""ctrl+alt+f"", ""command"": ""-workbench.action.terminal.focusFindWidget"",
""when"": ""terminalFocus"" },

""-workbench.action.terminal.focusFind""

UPDATES


Repaired .NET Core 2.1 installed version 2.2 as well
uninstalled VS 2019 and re installed
it does work on another machine with VS 2017 & VS 2019 installed (same versions)


UPDATES

I am facing this for quite a while and I really want to make use of the 2019 Version of VS. 

When opening a VS C# MVC project that is on Azure DevOps and works on all previous versions (2015-2017) is not working in 2019.

The first error I get is: 


.csproj : error: The tools version ""15.0"" is unrecognized. Available tools versions are ""14.0"", ""2.0"", ""3.5"", ""4.0"".


So I change the 15.0 to the suggested ones one by one and tried reloading the project, none solved the error, in fact I am getting another which is the following:


.csproj : error: The application for the project is not installed


No idea what I can/should do here.

Anyone can suggest me anything, has some info about it and so on?
",https://stackoverflow.com/questions/55589468/the-tools-version-15-0-is-unrecognized-incompatible-unloaded-project-in-visu,"
I've experienced a similar problem and one entry on ms docs:

https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/visualstudio/msbuild/updating-an-existing-application?view=vs-2017

has lead me to the answer.

If you ever had any older versions of visual studio installed, prior than 2017 you will have some unwanted dlls installed on the evil gac.
You should remove it by using these steps:


On poweshell run: gacutil.exe -l | Select-String -Pattern 'Build' | Select-String
-Pattern 'Version=15' 
Remove all found entries. Example:

gacutil.exe /u ""Microsoft.Build.Framework, Version=15.1.0.0, Culture=neutral, PublicKeyToken=b03f5f7f11d50a3a, processorArchitecture=MSIL""


This will make sure that vs will use it's current version to load the projects.
Please note that VS 2019 will always use ""Current"" and will ignore the ToolsVersion unless you force it to:

https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/visualstudio/msbuild/overriding-toolsversion-settings?view=vs-2019
............................................................
OK FIXED THIS ...

My visual studio 2017 MSBuild location:

C:\Program Files (x86)\Microsoft Visual Studio\Enterprise\MSBuild\15.0\Bin


My visual studio 2019 MSBuild location:

C:\Program Files (x86)\Microsoft Visual Studio\2019\Enterprise\MSBuild\15.0\Bin


I noticed that my Visual studio 2019 Bin folder was incomplete so i went on and took a back up (of course) and copied the complete Bin folder from 2017 to 2019.

This fixed everything ...
No idea what to say more here, just hopes it can help anyone!
............................................................
I have had the same exact issues with my attempted upgrade to VS 2019.However, what I have read is that the MSBuild version is supposed to correspond to the Visual Studio version. Hence, VS2017=MSBuild 15.x, VS2019=MSBuild 16.x.

When I installed both VS2019 and MSBuild 16.x at no time did I see in my GAC a build version for 16.x.For both VS2017 and VS2019 installs, the build versions were always at 15.0.

So far, I have had to return to my version of VS2015, which runs all my projects as expected.Not sure what to do since I couldn't get any help from Microsoft technical support without paying $500.00.
............................................................
Upgrading from MSVS2017 to MSVS2019, and then opening a MSVS2017 project may result with error ""The application for the project is not installed""
Try the following to fix the error

Close MSVS2019
Open Explorer > [Project Folder]/.vs/[Project Name]
Delete v15 subfolder
Open MSVS2019 > Project (should now open)
Right click on Solution Explorer > Project
Select Retarget Projects

I've been switched over to the new Google Apps Script IDE.
If I have multiple .gs and html files in one script document I used to be able to make changes on a file a close that without saving.Now the tabs are no more and you click directly on the filename and all you can do is undo until the file is reverted.
Is there a way to revert in one step?
thanks
",https://stackoverflow.com/questions/65741005/how-do-i-discard-changes-in-new-google-apps-script-ide,"
The new code editor has no way to close an unsaved files' edit session.There is no good way to revert back to the last saved content.The only option you have is to close or refresh the browser tab.If you close or refresh the browser tab and you have other unsaved open file sessions that you want saved, then make sure to save the ones you want.

Problem with dark classic theme in Eclipse 2020-12 (4.18) for C/C++. Menu have all black color:

Top panel has the same problem:

",https://stackoverflow.com/questions/65455086/eclipse-ide-for-embedded-c-c-developers-2020-12-classic-dark-theme-deep-bla,"
That's a bug of Eclipse TMF which is contained by default in the

Eclipse IDE for C/C++ Developers and the
Eclipse IDE for Embedded C/C++ Developers

in Eclipse 2020-12 (4.18) that has already been fixed:
Eclipse bug 569790 - [dark] Dark mode issue when Trace Compass is installed
Unfortunately, this bug was detected and fixed only shortly after the 2020-12 release. So I created the following (unofficial) update site that can be used to get the patched Eclipse TMF (via Help > Install New Software...):
https://howlger.github.io/Dark-Theme-Fix-for-Eclipse-2020-12-with-TMF/update
Update: the official update site has been published in the meantime:
https://download.eclipse.org/tracecompass/stable/repository/
Alternatively, you can use another dark theme instead of the built-in dark theme, such as one of the following (do not use the Darkest Dark Theme with DevStyle since it might slow down Eclipse and can cause issues):

Eclipse Spectrum Dark Theme
Planet Themes

Please note, a dark theme is a bit more stressful for your eyes compared to a light theme (the human eye can adapt well to dark, but works best with more light).

After using Apache Netbeans 12.1 for some days, today (without touching the installation folders) I tried to create a new project but I got the error message

""Project Folder already exists and is not empty""

NetBeans creates instead a ""default folder"", that doesn't open automatically in which you cannot create any package or class.

I used to save my projects in a different folder in my hard disk instead of the default one (the one that NetBeans creates inside ""Documents"") but I've never got any kind of problem.

I deleted all my folders in which I used to have Java projects and i re-installed NetBeans, Java and JDK many and many times (trying different methods like uninstalling from control panel, from uninstall.exe, etc...) but I was not able to solve it.
I started to think that may be a compatibility issue with NetBeans and JDK because I'm not able to create any package or class and also because after the reinstallation I noticed that the NetBeans User Interface changed, like it was a new version of the software (may be not compatible with my JDK yet?).

I'm currently using Windows 10. Thanks for your time.
",https://stackoverflow.com/questions/64947255/project-folder-already-exists-and-is-not-empty-in-apache-netbeans-12-1,"
That means the default project destination folder that NetBeans picking up for you (or you manually) is not empty and has some files inside it. Open the Explorer and create a new folder inside the same directory and select that while creating a Project.

",https://stackoverflow.com/questions/60804243/marlin-2-0-5-compiling-error-collect2-exe,"
You try to compile a version which is not prepared for the ArduinoIDE, probably try with PlatformIO. The loop() routine is missing, which ArduinoIDE needs for compiling. Read the instructions of the Marlin version, which environment to use for compiling and flashing.

As a step by step check:
You have the lastest version from here:

https://github.com/MarlinFirmware/Marlin


You have ArduinoIDE stable latest:(as of 23.3.2020) 1.8.12
You have the latest core for your board (e.g. for MEGA based): v 1.8.2 
Check if the used libraries are the latest.
Load marlin.ino (from the source above) 
Choose the correct board (e.g. MEGA), the correct settings and try again.

If it still throws the same error check your IDE and make a clean install.

I'm new to Atom Editor. Currently working on a PHP project which needs to push into the Github repo. I have initialized the project folder using git init command in the Atom IDE terminal itself. When I try to push the changes into the git. I throw various error messages I followed the command given in the terminal but doesn't work either. 

When I tried to execute git push I get below error message


fatal: '' does not appear to be a git repository

If the IDE somehow fails, step back and go to the command line (shell or CMD)

In the root folder of your project, check that there is a .git/ subfolder.

Type git remote -v.

If you do not see an entry ""origin"" with the URL of your remote repo, type:

git remote add origin /url/remote/repo


You should see:

C:\Users\vonc\git\go-prompt>git remote -v
originhttps://github.com/VonC/go-prompt (fetch)
originhttps://github.com/VonC/go-prompt (push)


Then, assuming you have added/committed file, try again the

git push -u origin master
# not master master, but origin master

Whenever a Executable is opened,the delphi IDE opens as like debug mode. what settings has changed in my IDE? 

Can any one help me! 

Update: 1. Build taken in other machine also causing this issue. 
How come a opening an EXE, starts the IDE?


Default debugger was modified from vcjitdebugger to delphi debugger. So in case of exception delphi instance was started. It can me modified as below:


You need to delete the following registry key:

HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\SOFTWARE\Microsoft\Windows NT\CurrentVersion\AeDebug\Debugger
On a 64 bit system delete this key also:

HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\SOFTWARE\Wow6432Node\Microsoft\Windows NT\CurrentVersion\AeDebug\Debugger
",https://stackoverflow.com/questions/58444805/delphi-executable-starts-in-debug-mode,"
At the top of your IDE, you have a combo box with the available layouts of the IDE.
You probably have ‘Debug layout’ selected instead of ‘Default layout’ or so...



When you have opened a project, select 'Default layout' and then it will persist that choice for the next time you open a project.

I am debuging a script in PyCharm. I am changing the code and run it again and again. Importing modules takes a lot of time, more than execution time of other lines of my code. I would like to avoid wasting time on importing modules. Something like restarting needed cells of my codewithout restarting the python kernel in scientific mode, but staying in normal mode. Can I do it?
",https://stackoverflow.com/questions/56056518/how-to-avoid-wasting-time-on-importing-modules-when-i-restart-my-code-multiple-t,"
You can maintain the imported state either by using the debugger or the console. 

The easiest way is to execute selections in the console after importing the modules. Select (or place the caret in) lines of code and press alt+shift+e.

In the debugger, you can evaluate expressions or alter code after modules have already been imported by setting breakpoints.

Either of these could be simplified by placing the desired modules in the __init__.py file.

I have a class A that is inside a namespace N in C++, so I can refer to it in the code with N::A.
I need, in Eclipse CDT, to take that class out of the namespace N.
Of course, I also need to edit all the occurrencies that refer to such class with the N::A notation in the codebase, so that the part referring to the namespace N is removed.
I was wondering if, in Eclipse, there is a way to do that automatically, so that I don't have to do it manually everywhere in the code.
",https://stackoverflow.com/questions/66066993/how-can-i-take-a-class-out-of-a-namespace-automatically-with-eclipse-cdt,"
One plausible method is by using using N::A to load the class A to the global namespace. And then you can use the Eclipse CDT's find and replace feature to edit out all the N::A occurrences to A.
You can either place using N::A only in the files where you want the class to be in the global namespace or else you can define it at the end of the class's header file so that it will automatically be defined in every file which includes the class. Using it this way means that only the A class gets dumped to the global namespace whereas using using namespace N; dumps every single content of that namespace to the global namespace.

The problem started happening after upgrading GCC to version 10 on Ubuntu 20.04.Basically my code gets highlighted and inspected fine until I include a standard library header (string for example). Sometimes when I remove the include line the highlighting comes back and sometimes it comes back only if I restart CLion after removing the line. The code compiles fine. I already tried reinstalling GCC, CLion and whole Ubuntu and the problem is exactly the same. The problem is not consistent for all the headers because cstdint works fine and doesn't break anything but string, map and iostream do. I don't have any external plugins, it's a totally fresh install of the newest CLion and Ubuntu. Going back to GCC-9 fixes the problem, but GCC-10 just doesn't seem to work.

Trouble in CLion happens sometimes when the software detects that it uses too much memory. The only solution that I know is to close some files and reopen the one on which you want the functionnality.

I am using Eclipse Oxygen (Ver 4.7.0) on CentOS with the UI shown via MobaXterm's X Windows server on Windows 7.

In Eclipse I have the weird problem that when I right-click on an editor tab the tab closes immediately! No context menu, nothing, just the tab vanishes. I would like to disable this, but I couldn't find any entry for right-clicking in the Keys section of the Preferences.

Is there another place where the right-click behaviour is set? Or how else can I disable this? The problem occurs only for editor tabs.

Additional details:


The right-click behaves correctly inside an editor tab by bringing up the context menu. This shows that the right-click is not genearlly broken in the X Window system.
The right-click behaves correctly in other X applications like PyCharm.

",https://stackoverflow.com/questions/60385884/in-eclipse-ide-how-to-disable-the-closing-of-an-editor-tab-via-plain-right-click,"
An explanation

A closer look revealed that Eclipse does show the context menu on right-click press-down, but on right-click release-up it registers a left-click event. 

Due to the particular situation of when the context menu was drawn, the mouse pointer than just always happens to sit over the top entry in the menu. And this top entry is Close. The following screenshot might illustrate this a bit (unfortunately without the mouse pointer):



Solution

The immediate solution for me is to move the mouse after pressing the right mouse button andbefore releasing it. 

Still I don't know why this happens only when right-clicking a tab and only for me - and probably not for many other people...

I've looked for improving my coding experience and read blogs about ligatures like this one. While interesting as a concept, all the resources I've found are about FiraCode. The impression I've got is that it's de facto standard and virtually the only font available for ligaturing in coding context.

The problem is that I find it a bit unpleasant for the eyes. It's tightened up compared to my beloved Consolas. Probably, what's so appealing is the monospace style of it, which doesn't need to collide with the ligatures. I'd like to see an extension to Consolas (or similar) that substitutes all the characters for ligatures only on the arrows, comparers etc.

Is there such a thing or did I google it right, not finding jack?

I'm afraid it isn't possible without an extension, although you can write an snippet to make your work easy.
To create or edit your own snippets, select User Snippets under File > Preferences (Code > Preferences on macOS), and then select the language. Write the following in the file and save it:
{
""Default file"": {
""prefix"": ""main"",
""body"": [""#include <iostream>"", ""#include <iomanip>"", ""#include <math.h>"", ""\nusing namespace std;"", ""\nint main() {"", ""\nreturn 0;"", ""\n}""],
""description"": ""My default cpp file""
}

}
Now, in some *.cpp file, start write ""main"" and VSCODE will show you the complete word. Just hit tab and voila.

I've made a Macros to create filters (just 3 columns' data) on a large (16k rows) data set. This is the 3rd iteration of this Macros I've created using relative references each time.
When I made the 2nd iteration, I ran into the problem of ""The starting range row is too small"". When I opened the script to look, the page went unresponsive, forcing me to kill the page. After logging out of my secondary google account, I tried again and was able to edit the script.

Possible solutions:

Wait for the page to react for a long time

Try clearing your browser cache, storage and cookies

Open in incognito mode, login and view

If you're using a bound script, make a copy of the script container, else make a copy of the script using Google drive

Check the dashboard for any pending executions

Use clasp/google-apps-script-api to get a copy in the terminal.

I've installed new version of RAD Studio 10.3 a couple days ago on my system Windows 10 Pro 64bit. It required to login with admin rights, i did it.
Then I started RAD Studio from non-administrative account, and when IDE started, I clicked ""File - New"", and all default items from object repository were lost.
There was no items like ""Console application"", or ""Windows Application"". Only folder ""Other - Unit Test"", with three items: ""Code Template"", ""Project Group"", ""Text File"".

Then I restarted RAD Studio from an administrative account. All items were in list: Console Application, Windows Application, FireMonkey Application.
Then I restarted again from non-administrative account. And no items again.

I searched in web for that problem, it seems it doesn't load items from object repository, when logged in from non-administrative account. But what is the reason? I gave full read/write access in every folder of ""Environment Variables"" for all user.

I could rename it, but I had no important settings saved, so I deleted it.

And then I've restarted RAD Studio from non-administrative account. Regedit branch was recreated, and everything became fine. Standart project items appeared.
I think that issue was because of first launch of RAD Studio was by admin account. And it created some wrong paths (which exactly, I didn't find).

Now everything is okay.

",https://stackoverflow.com/questions/61282338/how-to-correctly-make-a-counter-work-in-java,"
If you want to increment a counter variable then you can do:

banana = banana + 1;( or banana ++; ) // Increment by 1
banana = banana + 2;( or banana += 2; ) // Increment by 2
banana = banana + 2;( or banana += 3; ) // increment by 3
etc.....


If you want to check if a counter variable has reached a specific threshold then you can do:

String msg = """";
if (banana == 20) {
msg = ""You have reached your expected banana count of 20."";
banana = 0;
}
else if (banana > 20) {
msg = ""You have exceeded your banana count by "" + 
(banana - 20) + "" bananas. Starting again from 0"";
banana = 0;
}
else {
msg = ""You have added "" + banana + "" bananas. Keep going."";
}

How do I run rustfmt automatically when I save a file in IntelliJ or CLion?
",https://stackoverflow.com/questions/59512214/execute-rustfmt-on-file-save-in-intellij-or-clion,"
It should be noted that while bit2pixel's answer will work, (and indeed is how I did it for a good long while), there's a newer (better?) way.The rust-plugin has an option to handle this automatically.

............................................................

Make sure you have File Watchers plugin via Preferences -> Plugins -> Installed. If it's not installed, go to the Marketplace tab and search for File Watchers, install it, and restart your IDE.
Go to Preferences -> Tools -> File Watchers.


Add a new watcher and name it rustfmt. 


Configure the watcher by following the screenshot below. Enter the path to rustfmt into the Program field; it can be found in your Cargo bin directory. 



If you don't know where Cargo bin directory directory is, type which rustfmt in your terminal and copy the path. If you still can't find it, make sure you followed the instructions in Installing Rust.

My Airflow DAGs mainly consist of PythonOperators, and I would like to use my Python IDEs debug tools to develop python ""inside"" airflow. - I rely on Airflow's database connectors, which I think would be ugly to move ""out"" of airflow for development.

I have been using Airflow for a bit, and have so far only achieved development and debugging via the CLI. Which is starting to get tiresome.

Does anyone know of a nice way to set up PyCharm, or another IDE, that enables me to use the IDE's debug toolset when running airflow test ..?
",https://stackoverflow.com/questions/58931845/debugging-airflow-tasks-with-ide-tools,"
Might be a little late to the party, but been looking for a solution to this as well. Wanted to be able to debug code as close to ""production mode"" as possible (so nothing with test etc).
Found a solution in the form of the ""Python Debug Server"".
It works the other way around: Your IDE listens and the connection is made from the remote script to your editor.
Just add a new run configuration of type ""Python Debug Server"".
You'll get a screen telling you to pip install pydevd-pycharm remotely. At that same page you can fill in your local IP and a port on which the debugger should be available and optional path mappings.
After that, just add the proposed 2 lines of code to where you want your debug session to start.
Run the configuration to activate the listener and if all is well your editor should break as soon as the location of the settrace-call is reached.

Edit/Note: If you stop the configuration in your editor, airflow will continue with the task, be sure to realise that.
............................................................
It might be somewhat of a hack, but I found one way to set up PyCharm:


Use which airflow to the local airflow environment - which in my case is just a pipenv
Add a new run configuration in PyCharm
Set the python ""Script path"" to said airflow script
Set Parameters to test a task: test dag_x task_y 2019-11-19


This have only been validated with the SequentialExecutor, which might be important.

It sucks that I have to change test parameters in the run configuration for every new debug/development task, but so far this is pretty useful for setting breakpoints and stepping through code while ""inside"" the local airflow environment.
............................................................
For VSCode, the following debug configuration attaches the builtin debugger
{
""name"": ""Airflow Test - Example"",
""type"": ""python"",
""request"": ""launch"",
""program"": ""`pyenv which airflow`"",// or path to airflow 
""console"": ""integratedTerminal"",
""args"": [ // exact formulation may depend on airflow 1.0 vs 2.0
""test"",
""mydag"",
""mytask"",
""`date +%Y-%m-%dT00:00:00`"", // current date 
""-sd"",
""path/to/mydag"" // providing the subdirectory makes this faster
]
}

I'd assume there are similar configs that work for other IDEs
............................................................
I debug airflow test dag_id task_id, run on a vagrant machine, using PyCharm.You should be able to use the same method, even if you're running airflow directly on localhost.

Pycharm's documentation on this subject should show you how to create an appropriate ""Python Remote Debug"" configuration.When you run this config, it waits to be contacted by the bit of code that you've added someplace (for example in one of your operators).And then you can debug as normal, with breakpoints set in Pycharm.

Is it possible to set one colour for // comments and another for # in PhpStorm IDE?

I would like to use # comments for short descriptions on how the code works or for indicating some sections in classes (like # Accessors, # Calculations etc followed by adequate methods) and // for temporary comments. For this it would be extremely helpful to have different colours.

I don't think this is possible with default PhpStorm setup (hope I am wrong), but maybe is there an plugin for such thing?

I'm trying to find way to remote connect to a Linux server that contains my source files, or even on a VM with Linux on my Windows PC.
The main thing I want is to be able to use an IDE on Windows to edit the code, and connect the remote host with the sources and GCC or remote into the Linux machine to do the compilation on there.
",https://stackoverflow.com/questions/56647260/is-there-any-way-to-host-the-ide-in-windows-but-the-source-and-compile-gcc-on,"
Visual Studio (2017+) has a ""Linux Project"" template that uses SSH to compile remotely.
More info here.
............................................................
You can perfectly use a VCS for this. Just create a git repository and always push your code to it. Then, you can let the remote server pull in the changes and compile the sources.

This is exactly what build servers do.

When I run eclipse for the first time, it runs perfectly till I create a project in it.
But when I create a project, it is not opening up. It's showing in the task manager.
Every time I delete all the. metadata file from the workspace, then it will open perfectly again.
I don't understand why?
Please Help Me

Okay, so I'm new to coding, so don't kill me. I just started about a year ago and I use repl.it. I want to learn how to save user data. Also I want to know what python IDE is best suited for this.
",https://stackoverflow.com/questions/59914258/good-python-module-for-saving-data,"
If you want human-readable cross-programming-language data files, check out the json module.

If you want data that is faster, but that only python can read, check out the pickle module.
............................................................
About your IDE Question:
From my point of view, you don`t need an full featured IDE at this point, though PyCharm is quite nice, despite the fact that it's written in java xD... (and it has a ton oof features that will be noise for a beginner (ME 2 ...)) you can make sth. like VS Code quite easy to sth. like a lightweight IDE. If you don't like Microsoft, go for Sublime, or Atom (both also Editors with nice plugins and extensions for Python and other languages...)
If you want to go for scientific python features: check out https://www.spyder-ide.org/

Download a version on IntelliJ Idea with bundled JBR8 from the other versions page of the Jetbrains website.
............................................................
IntelliJ IDEA 2018.3.6 precisely supports 32-bit Windows OS (checked on Windows 7 x86). 
I've also checked version 2019.3.1 (.exe and .zip) but it supports 64-bit systems only.
............................................................
Download an older version of IntelliJ. They have other versions available. Read the release notes and find the one that suits your requirements. The 2017 release should work. You will have to manually install the JDK package though. There's a discussion on that. To be completely honest, support for Windows 7 has almost completely faded out on all applications, since it is now considered obsolete. Check if Eclipse/BlueJ satisfies your requirements. You might also want to try deleting all the IntelliJ software and restarting your computer, then go through the download process carefully.

BlueJ v 4.1.4 supports 32-bit systems. Most IDEs now work with Java 11 and beyond, and Java 11 itself requires 64-bit systems. As the BlueJ website states, over 95% of users have a 64-bit system now, so 32-bit is a waste of development resources.

Switched back again to PyCharm recently. VS Code has this handy inline merge conflict resolver which you could select the action you want, and for trickier conflicts, you could move the line up/down, update the codes, etc and after that you could click the action you want:

And Atom has similar feature:

But it seems there's no equivalent feature/plugin in PyCharm or other IntelliJ-based IDEs? In PyCharm, need to summon a new window to resolve the conflicts. Tried also the Git Conflict and GitToolBox plugins, but still no similar feature. Am I missing something? Shouldn't JetBrains consider this feature?
",https://stackoverflow.com/questions/63593048/inline-merge-conflict-resolver-in-pycharm-intellij-jetbrains-ides,"
Unfortunately, there is no option to enable inline conflict resolution, but there is a feature request for it, please feel free to vote:
https://youtrack.jetbrains.com/issue/IDEA-140959
............................................................
IntelliJ does support conflict resolution. It has the feature you are looking for (and maybe more).
Once you are in a state of merge (or just a conflict), navigate VCS > Git > Resolve Conflicts. A window will pop open, where you can immediately decide to either accept ""Yours"" or ""Theirs"" changes, or if you want a fine-grain approach, click the Merge button.
That will open a window like so:

The left and right arrow buttons / ex-es will either accept theirs/yours changes to the merging file in the middle. This whole configuration can be made different, the panels can be changed, there are other buttons to merge the whole ""ours/theirs"" changes, hotkeys for some actions, and many other features.
The IntelliJ documentation talks about it in detail.

If you are running Pygame on a UNIX system, like a Linux server, try using a DummyVideoDriver:

os.environ[""SDL_VIDEODRIVER""] = ""dummy""

............................................................
From similar experience the most likely problem is something is wrong with one of your SDL packages. Try running the following.

import pygame
pygame.init()
pygame.display.list_modes()


If you get back an empty list, it's definitely because of the packages. Try reinstalling them.

Possibly related:

This problem might only affect Windows XP. Try adding one of these to your code:

or
import os
os.environ['SDL_VIDEODRIVER']='windlib'

Good luck.

Wild guess - is the DISPLAY environment variable set and/or required by the library, and not available?This could be the case if you're ssh-ing into the Linux machine you're running this on without providing the -X option.

Try the following:

import pygame
from pygame.locals import *
pygame.init()

On Linux you can solve the problem using x11.
Verify that your SDL was built with x11 support, otherwise build it yourself only after that you added some libraries in this way:
sudo apt install xorg-dev libx11-dev libgl1-mesa-glx

Maybe xorg-dev already installs libx11-dev

I'm a beginner for Neovim recently I have a problem that is when I run any python file immediately after that in my local folder auto-create a new file that has end file name is "".stats"".I posted this post wishes someone to can help me. Thank u for reading.
Here my image example:

Here is my init.vim link:
enter link description here
",https://stackoverflow.com/questions/66677007/file-stats-when-run-python-in-neovim,"
These files generated by pylint. If you have any plugin for auto-linting, which use this linter (such as ALE), .stats files will be generated each time you open/save python files, depending on the plugin settings.
If you want to continue using this linter, you can disable generating .stats files by specifying the persistent pylint option as n (default is y).
You can also try to set environment variable PYLINTHOME to point to your directory (FAQ), but there may be a problem with it.
And of course, if you want, you can exclude this linter from the list in the your plugin settings.
More about what the 'persistent' option does.
The problem is, most likely, in the interaction of the calling plugin and the called pylint, because behavior with generating .stats files in the same directory with the checked files only works in this case. If you call the pylint check yourself, without nvim plugin, these files will be generated as declared in FAQ.

I have a database defined in a datamodule (DataMod)

It appears you are mixing unit name and data module name. Your description hints that the units name is
unit DataMod;

If this is the case, then the data module class can not be TDataMod (and instance can not be DataMod).
Perhaps the name of the data module class is TDataModule2. Then the interface part would look like this:
unit DataMod;

interface

uses
System.SysUtils, System.Classes, IBX.IBSQL;

type
TDataModule2 = class(TDataModule)
IBSQL1: TIBSQL;
private
public
end;

And then the instance would be declared as:
var
DataModule2: TDataModule2;

Finally, to address the TIBSQL from your forms unit you would need to
add the unit name to the uses clause in the implementation section of the form unit:
uses DataMod;

refer to the TIBSQL instance as follows
DataModule2.IBSQL1.SQL.text := '...';

Why does VSCode do this?

It doesn't.At least, it's not supposed to, and I've never seen it happen.

Something must be wrong.

How can one debug this?

First, in the Command Palette (Ctrl+Shift+P), run ""Git: Show Git Output"".Keep that window open when you perform a commit and watch its output.Note that what you see in that output is every command that is run, along with its stderr output, but not stdout.

Second, try running git commit from a Terminal inside VSCode: Terminal → New Terminal.See if that reproduces the problem.Try the git config commands from there, etc.

Third, if none of that reveals the problem, try writing your own git wrapper script and set the git.path setting (settings.json, or File → Preferences → Settings → Git) to point at it.Have the wrapper script log everything it does.
............................................................
You should try below 

$ git config --global user.name ""Your Name""
$ git config --global user.email ""youremail@domain.com""

Another possibility would be that some hook is modifying commits being made.

Namely, check .git/hooks/ for a pre-commit (not the .sample) file, and if present, look what it does. Just rename it or move it out of /hooks to permanently invalidate it.

A simple test (to rule this out if it's not the case) would be to try

git commit -n -m ""test""


since -n temporarily invalidates these hooks.

My team works on a solution in Visual Studio 2019.The solution contains many dozens of projects.We do use solution filters, but there are occasions where it is more convenient overall to load the entire solution.
One thing that's less convenient is configuring multiple startup projects in a solution with many projects.

Is there any way to filter or sort the list of projects? Alternatively is there any way to define ""profiles"" of multiple start-up projects and apply start up actions as a group?

With the help of the Selenium IDE add-on for Firefox, I'm trying to publish a post on Facebook that will include a link, the post should also contain the usual 'link preview' (image and/or description text) scraped from the website I'm sharing.

For this purpose I played around with the following commands to no avail: ""type"" ; ""typeKeys"" ; ""SendKeys""... the result was actually expected because these commands mimic typing, and if you manually write a link (by typing it) while trying to publish a post on Facebook - the ""link preview"" (image and/or description) won't be loaded.I also tried to emulate pressing ""ctrl + [a/c/v]"" in 3 separate commands as a workaround after the link as a text was written in the 'update your status' field, but no luck with those. See the visual examples below:

Selenium IDE contains:

Store | https://9gag.com/ | link
[[bunch of irrelevant commands in-between]]
typeKeys | class=_1mf _1mj | ${link}


Result:
Screenshot 1 - imgur

If you publish the post this way, it'll end up like a plain text. Not a valid share. The thing I'm trying to achieve with Selenium IDE is what's shown on the screenshot below. You can achieve it by copying some absolute URL and pasting it (ctrl + v) inside the 'update your status' window on Facebook.

Result:
Screenshot 2- imgur

Important: Workarounds are welcome as always, but here's what's not welcome as a workaround from other off-topic non-Selenium related reasons:

Is there any way to get another editor, like VSCode, to format code ( JavaScript in my case, if it matters ) like the WebStorm IDE formats code by default? I'm not familiar with that IDE, but I'm hoping that it uses a config of some sort that can maybe be exported and imported in another editor. I tried looking for one, but couldn't find anything. 

The core problem, if it matters, is that all of our team members use WS to write code and they use the built in formatter, so if I use another one it creates inconsistencies and long commits when editing already written files. As you are probably guessing by now, I would like to use another editor, because I find IDE's bloated and slow. 
",https://stackoverflow.com/questions/55979587/webstorm-formatting-settings-port-to-another-editor,"
I don't know if there is a way to import Webstorm formatting rules into VS Code, but I think there is another solution:

I remember in one of the projects i worked on, we used a linter which also auto-formatted code. The advantage is that Webstorm and VSCode can pick pick the linter rules automatically, and then you have same formatting on both.

The downside is that you would need to agree with the team on what does rule will be and then configure them on the linter.

For example I have a local StringBuilder variable named builder. On VS2015, typing bui will show something like this:



However, when doing the same in VS2019, it's like this:


The reason I would want the same behavior as 2015, is if I press enter key, or '.' key, it would automatically accept the preselected entry builder. On the otherhand, when on 2019, pressing enter/. would add a new line/. and the output would be bui + new line/. , as compared to 2015's behavior builder on enter, and builder. upon pressing '.'. Also, I tried toggling the setting under Options → Text Editor → C# → IntelliSense → Enter key behavior → 'Only add new line on enter after end of fully typed word' and it did not produce the output I wanted.

How or what options should I set to achieve the same behavior as VS2015?

Make sure Toggle Completion Mode option is disabled in your machine.


In VS2019, Go Edit menu=>Intellisense=>Toggle Completion Mode. Click it to change its status.

Unchecked:
 

Checked(blue rectangle):


Then make sure you choose the Only add new line on enter after end of fully typed word.

I think the Toggle Completion Mode option is the main cause of your issue. Unchecked this option then the Enter behavior in Tools=>Options can work.

I am trying to build i3wm (https://github.com/i3/i3), inside my basic debian /chroot/stretch. I am using an IDE installed in my host, not in chroot. However, I realized it's complicated, because all include directives are resolved on host, instead of being resolved in /chroot/stretch ...
My question is:

How do I use an IDE (in my case, CLion) from host to build, and develop projects inside a chrooted environment?
Should I use a full blown VM, with X forwarding, instead of chroot?
any other tool?... May be I can download all dependencies on the host, without chroot, and somehow trick include into taking those headers, instead of ones in /usr/include ?

I am really new to C, and the fact that my development setup might mess with my system is a quite annoying, and I am surprised and couldn't find something like ""setup-your-tools-for-development"" instructions on google..
EDIT: so 2 years later myself here: forget vim and chroot, I use docker + VScode which works flawlessly.
",https://stackoverflow.com/questions/55483137/how-to-setup-ide-for-a-chrooted-project,"
Okey, I guess using VIM + Ctags is the only solution, no need for a VM...

I'm learning to code, and now i'm focusing on the C language. Recently, i bought a course about it and the IDE used by the teacher is Eclipse. At first i had some problems to run the code, but it was solved with a little research, but when i tried something as simple as put a printf() before a scanf(), things didn't worked as intended, scanf() is being executed before the printf() that preceds it, like you can see: 



Then, i tried to run the code on windows cmd, writing on a notepad, compiling with gcc and running on prompt, and it worked as intended: 



After that, i tried running the code on another IDE, Code Blocks, and the result was the same as running on cmd, it worked like intended: 



Now, to be clear, i know that fflush(stdout); command works if i insert it before scanf() and that it's buffer related (what i did notunderstand properly yet), but i don't understand why the problem exists on Eclipse, but it does not happen on other platforms. My teacher explained that it was related due windows being a domestic OS and being problematic with professional tools, like Eclipse. But still it doesn't makes sense to me, the same code on the same OS, work on a IDE and don't work on other. It is very problematic to write a imprevisible code in such basic level, quite impossible to trust any result or learn the language properly that way. Can anyone help me with that?

i will leave the code here, but like i said, it is very very simple, just to illustrate the problem: 

#include <stdio.h>

int main() {

int n;

printf(""Type an integer: "");
fflush(stdout);
scanf("" %d"", &n);

printf(""\nNumber = %d\n\n"", n);

return 0;
}

",https://stackoverflow.com/questions/62027262/unexpected-behavior-on-eclipse-console-for-c-language,"
Buffering is not always implemented consistently across different systems. Try this with you Eclipse setting.It should set stdout without buffering. 

#include <stdio.h>

int main() {
setvbuf(stdout, NULL, _IONBF, 0); // stdout as no bufferring
int n;

printf(""Type an integer: "");
fflush(stdout);
scanf("" %d"", &n);

printf(""\nNumber = %d\n\n"", n);
return 0;
}

In interpreter is a program that runs programs written in a particular language.The CPython interpreter in one interpreter for running Python programs.An Itegrated Development Environment (IDE) is a program writing and running programs, possible with an interpreter, in one or more languages.IDLE is an IDE specifically for Python that comes at least with CPython.

I wonder if there's a way to get a list of classes, constants and functions in a library without going through the code of that library? I don't mean something like intellisense, because it doesn't give you an overall view of the library, it just tells you how you can proceed from the first things you've typed in. I mean something like this.

I always import a library and then search for a summary of its API in its documentation page, but since I'm not a pro, I'm afraid I've been taking the dumb way the whole time. So I suspect there should/might be a faster way for getting this summary without leaving the IDE?

(Although I'm using VSCode as my IDE [and I'd be happy too if your answer is based on VSCode], this question might have a more generic solution which I'm unaware of, and thus not tagging it merely as a VSCode specific question.)
",https://stackoverflow.com/questions/59818921/get-the-api-reference-of-a-library-without-leaving-the-ide,"
I have found a VSCode-specific answer to this question here. First ctrl+click (or F12: Go to Definition) on the imported library to open its code. Then:

It depends on how complex your project is and what way to usage classes in markup it is using. For simpler ones, something from the tools listed here can be helpful https://www.keycdn.com/blog/remove-unused-css. If your project is more complex, and if classes are created in the JS part on the flight, and then used, there might be no way to do clean up automatically

Pycharm says REPORT.py file doesn't exist. However the code works perfectly.

Here is the image of the issue:



Now that is not the strangest part. I know sometimes when you working within a package you have to reference the package name: import package_name.filename so when I tried that it appears to have fixed the incorrect reporting.



But then...

Traceback (most recent call last):
File ""C:/Users/REDACTED/PycharmProjects/REDACTED/MAIN/MAIN.py"", line 2, in <module>
import MAIN.REPORTS as PDD
File ""C:\Users\REDACTED\PycharmProjects\REDACTED\MAIN\MAIN.py"", line 2, in <module>
import MAIN.REPORTS as PDD
ModuleNotFoundError: No module named 'MAIN.REPORTS'; 'MAIN' is not a package


This seams like a mistake with how Pycharm is checking for my file.

For the sake of completeness I also tried to import from.



Pycharm is also not marking this as invalid but I get a new interesting error when running the code:

Traceback (most recent call last):
File ""C:/Users/REDACTED/PycharmProjects/REDACTED/MAIN/MAIN.py"", line 2, in <module>
from MAIN import REPORTS as PDD
File ""C:\Users\REDACTED\PycharmProjects\REDACTED\MAIN\MAIN.py"", line 2, in <module>
from MAIN import REPORTS as PDD
ImportError: cannot import name 'REPORTS'


As request in the comments here is my folder structure:



Per suggestion in the comments I did try to import * but I still get the same reporting issue from Pycharm.



Update:

I believe I found out why the issue existed when trying to import from my package.

Due to my package name being MAIN and my main py file being MAIN.py I believe my code was trying to import from the py file and not the package.

After renaming my package to MAIN_PACK and doing import MAIN_PACK.REPORT as PDD the code works fine without any reporting from Pycharm saying it is not valid.

That at the vary least fixes the Pycharm reporting.


However that still does not explain why Pycharm reports that import REPORTS is not a module but still the code would work.Does anyone know why this is occurring?

Set the main folder as the source root. You can do that by right clicking the MAIN folder and navigating to the bottom of the list. Mark the directory as source root. Go into Pycharm settings under console and check add source roots to python path.

Pycharm uses source root to resolve imports. More information can be found here

https://www.jetbrains.com/help/pycharm/content-root.html

Relevant text from link:


Source roots (or source folders; shown as the Source root icon ).


These roots contain the actual source files and resources. PyCharmuses the source roots as the starting point for resolving imports.
 The files under the source roots are interpreted according to theirtype. PyCharm can parse, inspect, index, and compile the
contents ofthese roots.

I am just getting started with C++ and CLion IDE. I got this error after watching a YouTube video that showed how to get started on CLion. All I did was try to add GCC to CLion as the compiler for C++. Nothing else at all.

I've only been programming for about 3 months on HTML CSS & JS so this error is way over my head. Any help would be greatly appreciated!

Use full path to compiler or add the gcc path to PATH if you want to used just gcc.

I guess that if you specify C compiler as /usr/bin/gcc (or /usr/local/bin/gcc if you installed it there) and C++ compiler as /usr/bin/g++ in Preferences | Build, Execution, Deployment | Toolchains everything should work.

Mind that Linux is case-sensitive OS and GCC executable is gcc.

I am brand new to programming and making my way through the CS50 online course.

In lecture 2, David introduced CS50 IDE, which I am now using for the first time for Problem Set 2 - Readability. However, I am encountering some error messages when I try to run a simple ""hello, world"" program.

Here are the steps I am taking in order:


Open CS50 IDE
Sign in with my GitHub login
Execute cd to make sure I am in home directory
Execute mkdir hello to create a new directory in my home folder
Execute cd hello to navigate to the new directory
Execute open hello.c to create new file in the new directory


At this point everything looks familiar to me, so I test it with the simple ""hello, world"" program:

#include <cs50.h>
#include <stdio.h>

int main(void)
{
printf(""hello, world\n"");
}


I then run make hello and receive the below error message:

make: *** No rule to make target 'hello'. Stop.


I then noticed that even though I previously ran open hello.c there actually isn't a hello.c file in the hello directory on the left. So I manually right clicked the hello directory and selected New File and created hello.c and tried to run it again. I then get the below error message:

clang -ggdb3 -O0 -std=c11 -Wall -Werror -Wextra -Wno-sign-compare -Wno-unused-parameter -Wno-unused-variable -Wshadowhello.c-lcrypt -lcs50 -lm -o hello
/usr/bin/../lib/gcc/x86_64-linux-gnu/7.4.0/../../../x86_64-linux-gnu/crt1.o: In function `_start':
(.text+0x20): undefined reference to `main'
clang-7: error: linker command failed with exit code 1 (use -v to see invocation)
<builtin>: recipe for target 'hello' failed
make: *** [hello] Error 1


Does anyone know what I'm doing wrong here? I've googled around a few different responses to similar questions, but can't seem to solve the issue. I'm pretty confused, so any help would be much appreciated.

I'm also attaching a few screenshots of my window if helpful.

Turns out I was not saving the file before compiling. Marking as solved!
............................................................
In the CS50 IDE it seems to work best if you set up a new file in the file menu (""create file"")and name it before you begin writing your program. I had the same problem at first. It doesn't seem to know your file is there or perhaps more accurately, recognise it fully, unless you do this first. In other words CS50 IDE doesn't seem confident the file name or file exists unless you create it first of all from the file menu, in the correct directory. I don't know how this works on other compilers, but I imagine its done like this to help form the thinking pattern of ""C does not know X unless I declare X first""). glad you fixed it!

How can I limit DBeaver Data Editor to limit the result set size?
I know the default is 200 and we can configure it in settings/preferences for the ""Data Editor"" section but this filter seems to be applied after all the results are already fetched from remote DataBase to local.

How can I limit this 200 before sending the request to the Database itself?
Meaning, instead of issuing a ""Select * from..."" to the Databases and doing the 200 results set a filter on local, I want to configure DBeaver to send ""Select * from... LIMIT 200"" to remote DB.
",https://stackoverflow.com/questions/58757885/how-can-i-limit-dbeaver-data-editor-to-limit-result-set-size,"
By checking the ""Use SQL to limit fetch size"" check box you should get the effect you want.



You can verify dBeaver is behaving the way you expect by taking a look at the query in the dBeaver execution log. You will see ""LIMIT"" has been appended to your query.



https://github.com/dbeaver/dbeaver/wiki/SQL-Editor#results-panel

It's probably worth noting that you may also want to consider de-selecting the ""Refresh data on next page reading"" option or the ""Auto-fetch next segment"" option if you want to guarantee LIMIT is always selecting the set amount of rows. With both of these options turned on in addition to ""Use SQL to limit fetch size"", dBeaver will rerun the full result set as you scroll through your data and pass the last row. For example, when you execute the query the first time it will run with ""LIMIT 0, 200"", returning the first two hundred rows. When you scroll past row 200, a new query will be executed, with ""LIMIT 0, 400"". When you pass row 400 a new query will be run with ""LIMIT 0, 600"" and so on.

Your pom.xml file should be in a root directory, not in the main directory.

Closure doesn't understand that you're instantiating an instance of MyCustomElement from the document.createElement because it does not understand customElements.define's implications* on its internal type system you're creating an HTMLElement with a tag name of ""my-custom-element"".

add the Makefile of the target build. or

All you have to do is to run it in the terminal. python (nameoffile).py

In SourceLair, you get a fully featured terminal, plus a web server for running your Python applications.

For simple files, as you correctly found out, all you have to do is save the file and run it through your terminal, using python <your-file.py>.

4) I'm setting the cursor to desired position with mouse and then try to delete symbol c with delete button - nothing happens again

5) I'm trying to select 'abc' entirely with mouse double click - and it's also not working

What IS working: cursor manual positioning with mouse single click and symbol deletion with 'backspace' key

You must choose the right Project configuration (C project):



Remarque : you must have a project path without space. Exemple : C:\Ali\untiled\untiled.c

I've been losing changes I've made to some of my cells because although I saved the notebook file, I didn't actually run the cell (this is for both code and markdown cells). And when I close the file down there is no warning of the sort ""do you want to save changes?"".

I know the workaround is to just run cells before saving. But it's just not a robust working setup.

Anyone got solutions? I would even switch editor to something with a similar feel if there's an alternative.

I was trying to write code for vertical order traversal of a tree and my code prints the result on code::blocks however it is not printing the result when the same thing is run in the geekforgeeks online ide. Why is it doing this?

void getvert(Node* root,int hd,map<int,vector<int>>m){
if(root==NULL)return;
m[hd].push_back(root->data);
getvert(root->left,hd-1,m);
getvert(root->right,hd+1,m);
}



void verticalOrder(Node *root)
{
map<int,vector<int>>m;
int hd=0;
getvert(root,hd,m);

auto it=m.begin();
 for(;it!=m.end();it++)
 {
for (int i=0; i<it->second.size(); ++i)
cout<<it->second[i];
cout<<endl;
 }
}

",https://stackoverflow.com/questions/59758053/code-not-showing-result-on-online-compiler,"
The function getvert accepts the last argument, m, as a value. Changes made to it in the function are made to a local copy of the object. Hence, you don't see any changes in verticalOrder.

Change getvert so that it accepts m as a reference.

void getvert(Node* root,int hd, map<int,vector<int>>& m) // Need reference argument

We want to start working with liferay. But the server is too heavy and the developpers computer don't have enought RAM. We want to centralize the server instance.

In other words, we want to build a development server where all developpers can connect and directly develop in their web browser, compile, view the result and push the code to git repository.

I found some good cloud IDE like eclipse CHE and a good maven archetype for liferay projet. So i can build the projet with maven. But now i want to know if it is possible to configure Liferay like every developpers can work without troubling another. And if possible, How ?

The developpers can share the same database and can use different port. Maybe, the server can generate tempory URL like some online cloud editor.

I found this post Liferay With Multiple Server Instances, but i don't think is the best way because he create one server per project. I think is too heavy.

If necessary, We have kubernetes in our IS.
",https://stackoverflow.com/questions/57569235/liferay-cloud-ide-multiple-developpers-working-on-same-liferay-server,"
Liferay's tomcat bundle, by default, is configured to take a maximum of 2.5G for the process, but it can run with far less - the default only recently was bumped up, because many people never change the default and then wonder why production systems run out of memory. For 1 concurrent user (the sole developer) on a machine, I guess that the previous default of 1G heap space is enough. Are you saying that that's too much for your developers' machines? 

Having many developers on a shared server poses one problem: Yes, you may deploy different code from different machines, but: How about setting a breakpoint? Can you connect with multiple debuggers? If something fails, how do you know whos recent deployment caused the failure?

Sharing a server is an integration technique, not a development technique. If your developers don't have enough memory available for running their own Liferay server next to their IDE, it's a lot cheaper to upgrade their machines than to slow them down when everybody is accessing the same server and they can't properly debug. You pay the memory once, but your waiting developers by the hour.

Is it possible to share one server? Sure it is.
Is it possible to share one server without troubling each other? I doubt.

When you say: You think it's too heavy: What are you basing that assumption on? What does the actual developer machine look like and what keeps you from investing in the extra memory?

It's trivial to share some infrastructure - i.e. have all of them connect to the same database server (and give everyone their own schema). But just the extra effort and setup might require you to pay the developers by the hour as much as you'd otherwise pay for a couple of memory chips.

And yet another option is: Run Liferay on a remote server, but keep 1 instance per developer. This way you don't need the local memory, but can have the memory in the cloud. Calculate if you pay more for remote cloud machines than for local memory - that decision is up to you.

I am creating an application to detect faces using the firebase classes. However, I am having a compatibility issue between the com.android.support:support-v4:28.0.0 and com.google.android.gms: play-services-vision: 18.0.0 dependencies. I have tried several methods to solve this but so far I have not achieved anything that solved. Android studio returns me the following message: 


Dependencies using groupId com.android.support and androidx. * Can not
be combined but found IdeMavenCoordinates {myGroupId =
'com.android.support', myArtifactId = 'viewpager', myVersion = '28 .0.
0 ', myPacking =' aar ', myClassifier =' null '} and
IdeMavenCoordinates {myGroupId =' androidx.lifecycle ', myArtifactId
=' lifecycle-runtime ', myVersion =' 2.0.0 ', myPacking =' aar ', myClassifier = 'null'} incompatible dependencies less ... (Ctrl + F1)
Inspection info: There are some combinations of libraries, or tools
and libraries, that are incompatible, or can lead to bugs. One such
incompatibility is compiling with a version of the Android support
libraries that is not the latest version (or in particular, a lower
version than your targetSdkVersion).


Below the image with the description of the problem:
Gradle
",https://stackoverflow.com/questions/58224825/incompatible-appcompat-and-play-services-vision-dependencies-between-app-compat,"
Problem is happening because you are using the Support Library along with the version 18.0.0of the play-services-vision library which already migrated to AndroidX. 

You can see HERE that some libraries migrated to Android X (such as the play-services-vision)

So, you are getting this error because your app is using Support Library but play-services-vision is already using AndroidX.

In order to fix:

1) Migrate your app to AndroidX (recommended). More info HERE

2) Use an old version of play-services-vision (such as 'com.google.android.gms:play-services-vision:16.2.0' for example.)

This second option may fix your issue because play-services-ads:16.0.0 was still using Support Library as well.

PhpStorm uses yellow font for method names if it detects that the method is in use elsewhere in the app.

It uses a grey font for unused methods.

This is really helpful for identifying stale code.

But PhpStorm doesn't recognize my methods that I am using in the /routes directory since they are called magically from a string.

For example, I am only using the sendPayout method in /routes, but the chargeCustomer is called directly from within another method.



For example, this line in /routes/web.php should ideally force the sendPayout method shown in the screenshot to appear in yellow font.

Route::post('/api/send-offer','StripeController@sendPayout');


Is there any way to get PhpStorm to recognize this, either by changing settings or using a certain plugin?

I am using PhpStorm 2019.3.1, MacOS Catalina version 10.15.2, and Laravel 5.8. I already have the Laravel plugin installed to PhpStorm.

I have an odd issue with Android Studio. Occasionally I will try to rename something (right now it's a class), it will go through the process, rename it, and immediately undo the rename with no information or warning. This extremely frustrating and super odd. Does anyone know why this happens or what to do about it?

I've tried git clean -fdx and invalidate caches and restart multiple times, renaming the file then the class, and renaming to a random name to make sure it's not the name itself, but it won't go away.

Ok, I just broke down and manually created a file with the new name, pasted the old code in, changed the old name to the new name, deleted the old file, and when through and manually fixed all the ensuing build errors. Still not sure what the problem was in the first place, but this did the trick.

I'd like to be able to visually see the relationships of the files I require from every file in my project - that's because I'm using redux in my project, but there are probably cases where I introduced anti-pattern behaviour, by running code without dispatching an action creator first, and I'd love to visually check how complicated things are at this point.

Example: If A depends on B, and B depends on C, I'd love to visually see A with an arrow connected to B, with an arrow connected to C.

Is there any util, or IDE functionality to help me visualise my js code like that?

You can enable panel moving by switching off the option in View > Lock panes and toolbars, or pressing Ctrl+Shift+F5. From there, you can drag around panes as you wish. 

When you're done, you can lock them again with the same process. If you want to save the current layout, you can use Alt+Shift+S. Also, in the View > Window Layouts menu, you can see and launch preset layouts that mirror other editors such as R Studio and Matlab.

I'm not sure how to describe the question properly. I used to use IDE tools such as IntelliJIdea. One of the useful functions from intelliJ was to open an external file by clicking an imported variable or component. I wonder if there is such functionality in vscode too. Although I tried looking up in the document, I couldn't find information about it. Does vscode really not have that convenient functionality? 
",https://stackoverflow.com/questions/55333294/vscode-how-to-open-a-file-containing-a-variable-or-html-tag-by-clicking-it,"
Visual Studio Code does provide this feature. 

If you hold down the Ctrl key in VSCode and for example hover over a function call, a small info box appears (like shown below). 



If you now click on it (while still holding down Ctrl), VSCode automatically opens the corresponding file in a new tab and jumps to the line where the function was defined. 



This works for variables, instances of classes etc. as well.

I am working with some sample source code that comes with a book that I recently purchased.This sample source code does not use Maven.When I imported the sample source code into Eclipse, it created a zillion new projects, cluttering my Project Explorer.I want to organize all the source code from the book under one Master project, whose name is derived from the book.After playing around quite a bit, I came up with a working solution that is reproduced below:


Created a Maven project, choosing the book title as the Artifact Id
{thereby organizing all the child projects under the book title}
In the Maven project, created multiple directories from Eclipse,
one for each chapter of the book (New --> New Folder --> Folder name) {this ensures that Eclipse has visibility to the directories}
Closed Eclipse
Copied the source code, chapter by chapter, to each of the directories created under the Maven project
Relaunched Eclipse
Sequentially imported the projects from each directory created under the Maven project directory in Step #2 (Import --> General --> Projects from Folder or Archive)


Although I have been able to realize my goal, I am uncomfortable with the fact that I am creating the Maven project solely for the purpose of organizing multiple non-Maven projects under one parent project.I am not making any use of neat Maven features like dependency management.




Q)What is the best way to organize multiple non-Maven projects under one parent project in Eclipse?

",https://stackoverflow.com/questions/60134671/organizing-non-maven-source-code-in-eclipse-projects,"
First of all, if these projects are all test projects unrelated to other projects, you can just create a new Workspace in Eclipse.

If this is not what you want, you can define Working Sets that organise projects. 

It is usually not necessary to put projects into subfolders to organise them.

I need to customize SystemUI based on 6 to 9 but problem is when I am comparing the 6 source code patch to apply in 9, there are possibilities of missing import statement and method mapping
when I import the entire aosp project and do. But when I import the entire aosp project, it will not display compile error of System UI methods to import or missing class.

May I know which is the best IDE to use for aosp system apps? 
",https://stackoverflow.com/questions/59682479/which-ide-should-i-use-for-aosp-android,"
There is a tool called idegen to generate project files for IntelliJ and Eclipse.https://android.googlesource.com/platform/development/+/refs/heads/master/tools/idegen/README
If you're using IntelliJ...
If this is your first time using IDEGen...
Android is large, thus IDEA needs a lot of memory. Add ""-Xms1g -Xmx5g"" to
your VM options in ""Help > Edit Custom VM"" and increase the
file size limit in ""Help -> Edit custom properties"" by adding
""idea.max.intellisense.filesize=100000"". Make sure to restart the IDE for
the new settings to take effect.
Create a JDK configuration named ""1.8 (No Libraries)"" by adding a new
JDK like you normally would and then removing all of the jar entries
under the ""Classpath"" tab. This will ensure that you only get access to
Android's core libraries and not those from your desktop VM.
From the project's root directory...
Repeat these steps after each sync...
1) make (to produce generated .java source)
2) development/tools/idegen/idegen.sh
3) Open android.ipr in IntelliJ. If you already have the project open,
 hit the sync button in IntelliJ, and it will automatically detect the
 updated configuration.
If you get unexpected compilation errors from IntelliJ, try running
""Build -> Rebuild Project"". Sometimes IntelliJ gets confused after the
project changes significantly.

Note that some tweaks should be done in IntelliJ project for optimal performance https://web.archive.org/web/20220111212957/http://effie.io/opening-aosp-with-intellij-part-3/.
IntelliJ is very very good when modifying framework Java parts and very terrible if you need to change C / C++. For that I use VS code (I load just the module I need like Hwcomposer or tinyalsa HAL)

To develop aosp system apps, you should use Code Editing tool like Visual Code then build by AOSP build system (using makefile)

I'm trying to understand this C# 8 simplification feature:


IDE0063 'using' statement can be simplified


For example, I have:

void Method()
{
using (var client = new Client())
{
// pre code...
client.Do();
// post code...
} --> client.Dispose() was called here.
// more code...
}


IDE tells me I can simplify this using statement by writing this instead:

void Method()
{
using (var client = new Client());
// pre code...
client.Do();
// post code...
// more code...
}


I can't understand how it works and how it decides I'm not using the variable anymore. More specifically, when exactly does it call client.Dispose method?
",https://stackoverflow.com/questions/57460048/when-does-ide0063-dispose,"
You are using C# 8. In older C# versions that ; would have made this invalid. 

In the new syntax, the client stays in scope for the surrounding method (or other {} scope block). Note that you can omit the outer pair of () as well.

It's called a using declaration, the documentation is here.

void Method()
{
using var client = new Client();
// pre code...
client.Do();
// post code...
// more code...
} --> client.Dispose() is called here (at the latest)


Logically the Dispose happens at the } but the optimizer might do it earlier. 

Edit

I noticed that having // more code after the end of the using block, prevents this improvement from appearing. So there will be no more ambiguity if you convert the following code:

void Method()
{
// not relevant code

using (var client = new Client())
{
// pre code...
client.Do();
// post code...
}
}


into this code:

void Method()
{
// not relevant code

using var client = new Client();
// pre code...
client.Do();
// post code...
}

............................................................
The short answer is that the new (optional) using statement syntax inherits its parent's scope.

I have to agree with the OP that this is a very confusing change in C# 8.0, for many reasons.

Historically, using has always operated with a scope like other blocks (if, switch, etc.). And like if, the using statement's scope was the next line or block of code.

So it is perfectly valid to write something like:

using (var client = new Client())
client.Do();


This means client is only in scope for the single statement, which is great for single-line operations, like triggering a SQL stored procedure with no return value.

But now we also have:

using var client = new Client();
client.Do();


Which is not the same thing at all; client remains in-scope for the entire method.

Now, Visual Studio will only suggest this change if nothing came after your original using block, so it's functionally identical.But what if more code is added later? With the old scope notation, it was very clear whether the new code was in or out of scope.With the new syntax, everything after using is in scope, but that might not be clear.

The Roslyn team may have figured that this doesn't really matter.Unlike flow control statements (if, etc.), do you really care if your object stays in scope for a few more lines of code?Probably not. But like all things, it depends.

In some ways, it's an improvement since it clearly says, ""Instantiate this object and call Dispose() when it goes out of scope.""Objects are always destroyed and garbage collected when they go out of scope (i.e. method ends) but that does not mean that Dispose() is called.Adding using to a local variable declaration is just a way of making that happen.

Finally, and this is big, if you are targeting .NET Framework, you're probably not really using C# 8.0.

You may think you are; I did. You may be running Visual Studio 2019 16.3+. You may even have the latest version of the Microsoft.Net.Compilers package installed, and that says you're getting C# 8.0, right? But you're not. By default, .NET Framework is capped at C# 7.3.

In my tests, when I target .NET 4.8, Visual Studio is smart and won't offer C# 8.0 suggestions. But if I target an older version (4.7.2) I do get this suggestion, which then generates a build error. The IDE won't show you that error - your project looks clean - but you'll get two syntax errors when you actually build.

When targeting .NET 4.8, if you do try and use C# 8.0 syntax you'll get the friendly 


CS8370 C# Feature is not available in C# 7.3. Please use language version 8.0 or greater.


and an offer to add <LangVersion>8.0</LangVersion> to your project file (even though that's officially unsupported by Microsoft). It works, with caveats.But with older .NET versions that doesn't seem to be the case. So show extreme caution when accepting these new syntax hints on older projects!

UPDATE: I was wrong about older NET Framework versions triggering the hint. The culprit was an old version (2.10.0) of Microsoft.Net.Compilers. That was the last version compatible with older versions of Visual Studio. After removing that package, the hint is no longer offered.

I am new to Automation Testing and Selenium IDE. I have one testing case which update just the email and another testing case which check if the update email is the same on another page.Test passes if the compared email is the same. So far, I only found an option to update the values and wondering if there is any option to compare the updated values in different page. Any suggestion would be helpful. Just to clarify,

Test case 1(Action):
1. Open HR department page on browser 
2. Go to user profile and update user email

Test case 2(Check):
1. Open Employee department page on browser
2. Go to user profile and see if the update email from test case 1 is showing the same.

Because we're using different database for each departments, the test will passed if the email is the same, and the test will failed if the email is not the same on Selenium IDE.
",https://stackoverflow.com/questions/58140165/compare-values-in-selenium-ide,"
For Selenium IDE 3.16.1:

 Command|Target |Value 
Test case 1:
open| HR department page 
open| user prfile
type| user-email-locator1 (id=... css=...)| new@user.email 
store value | user-email-locator1 (id=... css=...)| var1

Test case 2:
open| Employee department page 
open| user prfile
store value | user-email-locator2 (id=... css=...)| var2
verify| var2| ${var1}


Run both testcases (You must write Test case 1 first).If var1 value equals var2 value, tests will completed successfully.
............................................................
Selenium inbuilt does not have a compare function.

In case of Java, you have to hold the user email of test case 1 in a variable 
In test case 2, capture the existing email displayed
then, compare both values using .equals ( Since email is String )

refer the same code below,
String testcase1_email=driver.findElement(By..).gettext();
String testcase2_email=driver.findElement(By..).gettext();
if(testcase1_email.equals(testcase2_email))
 System.out.println(""Email id Matches"")
else
System.out.println(""Email id does not Matches"")

Hope this helps

How can I enable a Node.js Intellisense in VS Code?

For instance, I am aware of a constant in Node.js __dirname, but when I try to type __dir in VS Code I am not getting any suggestions, while I would expect to see the __dirname as a suggestion.



What can I do about it? Maybe I should install a plugin?

I have installed the Gerrit plugin to Android Studio IDE. It is useful for the code review. 

But when I have my commit and someone reviews it in Gerrit, I see in the plugin, that the comment is there.
But there is no way how to see what the comment actually says. 

Is there a way, how to see the content of these comments inside the Android Studio? (either by plugin or some other way)

Problem: I am trying to force IDEA/Eclipse to open a README.md file, once project is imported into workspace. After searching for a bit already, I can't find a solution. So my question:


Is there a way to force IDE to open a file automatically?





I know that there are plugins for viewing mark-up files, but this is not what I am looking for

",https://stackoverflow.com/questions/59642521/automatically-open-a-file-when-project-is-imported-into-ide,"
IntelliJ Idea provides a CLI. When you try to open a pom.xml and there are no IntelliJ Idea project files, the project will be imported. Else the project will be opened. 

I assume from your comments, that you import new projects on a regular base. So, open the pom.xml, wait a few seconds to give IntelliJ the chance to create project files and then open the README.md will open that file in your fresh imported project.

The following bash script worked for me:

idea pom.xml & sleep 5 && idea README.md


Don't know if that is an option, because I don't your way to work. Do you like command lines or not aso.

I'm wondering if it's possible to bypass the OutputDebugString? I'd like the OutputDebugString output showing up in DebugView and not in the internal Delphi Event Viewer window. But i can't find a way to tell Delphi not to swallow the OutputDebugString. Any ideas?

regards
",https://stackoverflow.com/questions/3116069/bypass-outputdebugstring-in-delphi-7,"
That is not possible. 

OutputDebugString sends string to debugger (as its name suggests). There can be only 1 active debugger per process. You run your application under Delphi - Delphi got the messages, since its a debugger. You run your application outside Delphi - DebugView can access them, since no debugger claimed it.

However: WHY do you need this? Just disable other types of events in Delphi event log - and you'll get the same functionality as DebugView has.
............................................................
I think there is no way around this. The situation is still the same in Delphi 2009. You should submit a feature request: http://qc.embarcadero.com

I'm wondering what the advantage instead of Delphi's internal event log window should be?
............................................................
Instead of DebugView you can try to use Process Monitor and its new ""debug output"" capability. It does not use OutputDebugString, it uses its own API, and there's also a Delphi wrapper here. You can use Process Monitor filtering features and Delphi won't trap that messages - but it's not a generic features as those of OutputDebugString.
............................................................
Disabling ""output messages"" in the Event Log properties does not work?
............................................................
Not what the original question asked, I realise, but it's worth taking a look at CodeSite from Raize Software. It takes OutputDebugString to a whole new level. Messages (can) get directed to a CodeSite viewer which is roughly equivalent to a highly souped up DebugView. Well worth every penny IMHO.

IntelliJ: Generate switch case

(2 answers)


Closed 2 years ago.





Due to internal company changes, I am forced to switch from Eclipse to IntelliJ. Unfortunately, I am extremely dissatisfied with the autocomplete capability of InteliJ.

For example, if I type ""swit"" and press Enter, Eclipse will generate the following code: 

switch (key) {
case value:

break type;

default:
throw new IllegalArgumentException(""Unexpected value: "" + key);
}


But if I do the same in IntelliJ, I will get this as a result:

I'm developing a project on wifi-range extending using two ESP32 WROOM 32 modules as transmitter and receiver. So far I have completed the transmission side& it gives the following output for the given Arduino code.
Transmitter output in the serial monitor

In the receiver side I,m encountering an error.
The error is, though the transmitter transmitting the offer of IP to the receiver, the receiver is config to LR mode & only prints that the error is 0 and the ""Mode LR OK"" and continuously printing ""."" s. After that it is not connected to the Wifi transmitter ESP32. The output obtained from the receiver side is the following.

delay(500);
Serial.print(""."");
}

Serial.println(""WiFi connected"");
Serial.print(""IP address: "");

udp.begin( 8888 );
}

void loop() {
 //If there is a problems whith connection
if ( WiFi.status() != WL_CONNECTED ) 
{
Serial.println( ""|"" );
int tries = 0;
WiFi.begin( ssid, password );
while( WiFi.status() != WL_CONNECTED ) {
tries++;
if ( tries == 5 )
return;
Serial.println( toStr( WiFi.status() ) );
delay( 1000 );
}
Serial.print( ""Connected "" );
Serial.println( WiFi.localIP() );
}
//if connection is OK, execute command 'b' from master
int size = udp.parsePacket();

return;
char c = udp.read();
if ( c == 'b' ){
digitalWrite(5, !digitalRead(5));//toggle Led

Being a new user of Visual Studio Community (2017), I had the bad surprise to find that my C++ console application runs in a console external to the IDE.

So I would like to know how to make my program run directly in the IDE, as it is the case for Eclipse, VSCODE, IntelliJi etc....

In managed code, you could try to use System::Diagnostics::Debug::Write. In unmanaged code, You could try to use OutputDebugString. In both cases, the text will go to the Output window rather than the Immediate window. If you want it in the immediate window, inside VS you can go to Tools -> Options -> Debugging -> General and check the ""Redirect all Output Window text to the Immediate Window"" option.

Use the Immediate window to debug and evaluate expressions, execute statements, and print variable values. And we couldn't run the console application in the Immediate window.

As far as I'm concerned ,We couldn't equate the system console with an Immediate window. And A console application should run in the system console.
............................................................
If you run your program in the debugger of the IDE, you can use OutputDebugString instead of writing to standard output (i.e. std::cout). That way, your program's output will appear in the output window of the IDE.

However, this feature is only intended for debugging purposes and not for normal use.

So Xcode 11 changed the way editor panes are added and removed. Ok, fine, I got used to it soon enough. But a few days after using the Xcode 11 GM build, the option to add an editor is suddenly disabled.

It looks like you need to copy the downloaded file inside the Bundle using bash commands in the Run Script phase itself. Please use the following script to copy the resource to the bundle.

cp downloadedFile ${CONFIGURATION_BUILD_DIR}/${UNLOCALIZED_RESOURCES_FOLDER_PATH}/


UNLOCALIZED_RESOURCES_FOLDER_PATH is nothing but app path itself. Please see its value in Build logs.

export UNLOCALIZED_RESOURCES_FOLDER_PATH=TestProject.app


I tested this with my local file in Desktop folder and found it to be working.

You cannot use ""Copy Bundle Resource"" phase to copy the downloaded file at compile time. Because, to use ""Copy Bundle Resource"", it has to be added to the Target which is not possible when it is downloaded during compile time.

For Android Studio : use the Run > Flutter Run main.dart in Profile Mode menu item.

In VS Code, open your launch.json file, and set the flutterMode property to profile (when done profiling, change it back to release or debug)

I have a book that teaches physics for game developers.The code is generic C-style code.However, the examples use GUI's to interface with the code (variable initialization, start conditions, etc...). The GUI code is not implemented and is left to the reader.Ideally, at home on my MAC, I would like to use the GUI builder in Xcode to build these little interfaces and then use the GUI to run the code.However, I don't want to code the physics code in Swift or Objective-C, I just want to code it in C++ so that I can transfer the code to work (which is Windows and uses Visual Studios).If someone could just point me in the direction of a resource that explains how to have a MAC GUi call C++ code and do this all in Xcode, that would be great.

I have done some searches but I don't think I am a using the correct terminology to get the correct results.
",https://stackoverflow.com/questions/58528650/how-do-i-use-the-standard-xcode-gui-on-top-of-c-code,"
This is very broad.

General principles would be to have the physics code in its own set of portable C++ files. Regular C++ and headers. Basic structures exposed, maybe expose std:: containers but keep it generic.

Beside that, use the UI builder in xcode, but only ever refer to the physics code in code you write. This will look like:

nice_physics.cpp

// portable code here


nice_physics.h

class NicePhysic
{
public:
int nice_function(float);
};


brandname_ui.cpp

// hook generated by your IDE
UGLY_DECL_TYPE UGLY_MACRO valueChanged(UGLY_TYPE i)
{
NicePhysic phys; // move this object to wherever the UI system you use allows it
// make whatever calls you need to your physics system
phys.nice_function(0.5);
}

............................................................
Objective C++ is your answer. If you name your files with a .mm extension, you can use mix and match C++ features with Objective C features. You'll have two object systems running side by side. You can't derive C++ classes from Objective C classes and vice versa, but that's about the only major limitation. C++ code can construct ObjC objects and send ObjC messages, ObjC methods can instantiate and call C++ objects.

The ""Get started with JRebel"" popup should disappear after the user has activated JRebel and has made the first reload with it. So to get rid of the popups, the following steps must be completed:

In WebStorm, PyCharm, and other JetBrains products you can use JSDoc comments to inform WebStorm that an object does have a specific property, thereby eliminating a warning.

Either @namespace or @property works well for plain object properties, but I can't find a JSDoc command that works for functions.

const query = require(...);
...
Object.keys(record)
.forEach(col => {
query.set(col, record[col]);
});


In the snippet above, .set(...) is not recognized by WebStorm and produces an Unresolved function or method warning.

This is only a single example. My project uses multiple third-party libraries and many of those libraries have object methods that trigger the warning on use. There are no typescript definitions available for these libraries, and WebStorm's file analysis doesn't pick up on them.

I cannot modify the query object, nor can I change how it is imported. Is there a JSDoc comment I can add to eliminate the warning? I've tried multiple variations of @property, @param, @namespace, and @member.

notes:

I know that the warning can be disabled by using a // noinspection JSUnresolvedFunction on the line directly above the use of the function, but this is an inferior solution. The JSDoc comments can be placed in multiple scopes, such as the start of the class or function definition. The JSDoc solution also improves readability and has meaning in other, non-JetBrains IDEs.
",https://stackoverflow.com/questions/55691623/how-can-i-use-a-jsdoc-comment-to-eliminate-an-unresolved-function-or-method-wa,"
JSDoc provides the way to explicitly annotate symbols with @type

So in your example it's could be:

/** @type {QueryObjectTypeDef} */
const query = require(...);


Also same effect could be achieved (tested in WebStorm) with inline annotation of function args:

forEach((/* ColTypeDef */ col) => {...})

I am developing a python extension module with cython, but so far it's not being a good experience. The python I am using to test the extension is actually embedded in another software (blender).

I have to support Linux and windows versions of 32 and 64 bits, for now I am just compiling in 64bits for testing.

The problem is that every time I run Build, the module gets compiled to 

build\lib.win-amd64-3.7\c_fields.cp37-win_amd64.pyd but my testing folder where I import the module is in another place, so every time, I have to copy and paste it. I guess there are smarter ways of doing it.

I would like to know if there's a way to compile the module straight to my testing folder. so far I am using a .bat script to build the module:

build64.bat

python setup.py build_ext --plat-name=win-amd64
pause

",https://stackoverflow.com/questions/54007395/how-to-setup-a-python-extension-development-enviroment,"
Depending on your compiler, you can choose the build directory (When using distutils, you can compile using the parameter build_dir=""build"")

However, this is not a bad practice to compile inplace with the option --inplace

In my C++ code, I'd like to display ""UpArrow"" and possibly display it properly in MSVC/Xcode and maybe in Anjuta.

The character code is U+2191.

Trying to do:

ALT+2+1+9+1,

Is it possible to display the symbol inside the IDE cross-platform?
",https://stackoverflow.com/questions/56196079/displaying-unicode-character-cross-platform,"
You're really asking how to type the character, displaying it usually is not a problem.

If your keyboard layout has a Level 3 shift key (typically labelled AltGr on the physical keycap), press Shift+AltGr+u to produce ↑. Otherwise see https://superuser.com/a/78724/19948 – type Compose, up, up or Compose, minus, circumflex after installing the custom .XCompose file.

I found a few posts that explain how to keep a programmatically created window always on top.
I was unable however to find an explanation about how to keep always on top the IDE integrated Locals window, while I am debugging (I run the program with F10 for instance).
I see that there is no answer in a long time, so I realize that my question is not expressed clearly enough. I shall clarify.
Usually, while debugging, the active window is the IDE and so also the control keys (F10, F11 and so on) are also active. In the same time, the Locals window is on top and so one may watch the values of the variables while debugging.
In my case,while the IDE window is active, the Locals window is hidden and in order to see the Locals window, I have to press its tab on the status bar. when the Locals window appears (becomes active) and the values of the variables are visible, the IDE window becomes hidden and the control keys ate not active anymore. I have to press the tab of the IDE window on the taskbar in order to resume debugging.
Please help.
Thank you in advance.
",https://stackoverflow.com/questions/56149188/how-do-i-keep-the-locals-ide-window-always-on-top-while-debugging,"
It sounds like your locals panel is auto-hiding as is your main code panel, or are they actually in separate windows? Assuming the same window but differing panels...

There should be a dropdown option with pin or auto-hide or float, you may also find that dragging the locals window (by titlebar) to another panel that remains open to be a better option, or drag it to be a floating window and resize the IDE to be 3/4 of screen and locals to the remaining 1/4. The final option is to close the locals window and reopen a new one using the Debug menu and then experiment with new positioning and docking options. 

One last resort may be to reset the window layout to default and get back to the way it should be setup.

Good luck and let us know how you fare.

I need to know if there is any way or plugin to run dart code on Xcode for flutter app development. If there is any mention here, every time I searched on internet it only shows me flutter commands for terminal to run app on iOS. I want my IDE to be XCODE for flutter development. here is what flutter official documentations says when I ask same question
Flutter Documentation about MacOS
Thanks in advance. 
",https://stackoverflow.com/questions/55119393/how-to-install-flutter-and-dart-in-xcode-macosx,"
You can install and use flutter on macOS. But you can not use XCode as IDE, officially they announced either use Android Studio / IntelliJ or Visual Studio Code.

For Android Studio / IntelliJ:

https://flutter.dev/docs/get-started/editor?tab=androidstudio

For Visual Studio Code:

https://flutter.dev/docs/get-started/editor?tab=vscode

As a suggestion iOS or other developer should use VSCode its light weighted and more understandable and android developer have their own option.




............................................................
Dart and Flutter are officially supported by IntelliJ/Android Studio and VSCode.

I think there is some integration with VIM and Emacs, but not officially supported. There is no integration with XCode though.

Locate and remove header.php (or very similar one) pattern from bottom table and remove it.


Right now you have somehow told IDE to treat such file as Plain text and it does it for all files named header.php regardless of their location (quite likely it happened when you were creating new header file and forgot to enter .php part).

I've been trying for several hours now and I am probably overlooking something or doing something stupid.

I have a work PC with windows 10 and I installed, github desktop, Git (bash/gui/cmd) and Atom. I wanted to use atom as my IDE and avoid using github desktop (if necessary add some packages to atom).

Now I keep running into the problem that atom says that there are no remotes hosted at the repository; I'm sure there are as I can see them with github desktop as wel as online. Now I feel that the problem is because I need to use github enterprise as such I've tried cloning/pulling from here:
https://github.COMPANYNAMEHERE.be/myusernamehere/hello-world.git 
Ofcourse I removed the company name and directory.

The other error it gives is the following:


remote: Password authentication is not available for Git operations. remote: You must use a personal access token or SSH key. remote: See
https://github.company.be/settings/tokens or
https://github.company.be/settings/ssh fatal: unable to access

URL returned error: 403


I had some other errors as well as I tried a bunch of stuff.

Can anyone help me out with either solving this problem.
Please note I'm not an ICT expert, I do some very simple linux, python and matlab coding because I need it for the research I'm doing. It's the plan to use github to better centralize information and scripts.

I want an IDE that I can simply run that can simply pull/fetch projects from GitHub Enterprise, let's me edit them properly with auto complete and color-coding, and let's me then commit them with necessary comments. I want to do this without having to swap between programs.

Working with some project I'd really like to keep like 8-10 tabs (=files) open at the same time within IntelliJ IDEA as I have to switch between those very often. However the space on the screen is limited especially if the Project Browser and the Remote Host Browser are also open at the same time.

Usually its not that much of a problem but as soon as some remote files are open the labels become very long and therefore the space for tabs decreases even more. Look at the following picture:



A maximum of four tabs at the same time is visible - sometimes only three.

Its not like others have not found very elegant solutions for this - look at the ""pinned tabs"" feature of google Chrome for instance:



Is there some setting, extension or other possibility how to deal with this problem in IntelliJ? After some research I have only found out that you can switch recent files with Ctrl + E but in my opinion this still is a quite clumsy way to deal with it (especially as it does not work for remote files) 🤕

I have a public class with private fields and public setter methods to set those fields. Why IntelliJ IDEA is warning me saying ""Access can be private"" for these setter methods?


",https://stackoverflow.com/questions/53830815/access-can-be-private-warning-message-for-public-setter-mutator-methods-in-int,"
Simple: because IntelliJ doesn't see any usages for these method that would require them to be public in your project.

In other words: the IDE doesn't ""know"" that you made the setters public on purpose. It just figured: for what you are doing right now, you don't have to do that.

When writing ""truly"" public APIs, (maybe to be used by 3rd parties that later rely on your classes), this information is safe to ignore. So you might just go in and disable that warning, see here for example.

Beyond that: understand that you should avoid public setters where possible. Unless you have a ""data bean"" class, having setters/getters for each and any field is actually bad practice. You avoid outsiders to inspect internal state (using getters), and you very much want to prevent outsiders to overwrite internal state (using setters).
............................................................
It means they are not used outside of the class and don't need to be public.

Restricting the access of methods keeps your interfaces small and reduces the chance of bugs creeping into your programs.
............................................................
IntelliJ IDEA is intelligent enough to scan your packages and class references within a package and if it notices that the usage is enclosed primarily to a certain package, then it will try to instill some discipline of adherence to encapsulation principles, and in this case: package privateness.
 If a class has no modifier (the default, also known as package-private), it is visible only within its own package (packages are named groups of related classes.

I'm running IAR Embedded Workbench 8.30.1.17148.When I enter debug / step mode, it opens the disassembly window and starts stepping at the disassembly level -- not at the source code level.

I can close the disassembly window and restart the program, but like an unwelcome guest, the disassembly window opens again and it steps at the disassembly level.

How do I convince IAR Workbench that I really want to step at source level?
",https://stackoverflow.com/questions/54540428/how-to-disable-stepping-in-disassembly-mode-in-iar-workbench,"
I was getting so annoyed by this same behavior, I searched IAR FAQ to no avail, but got a speedy response from their support:

In regard to your question about the Assembly Window:
1. When the IDE is opened you can close the Assemblt window by selecting the ""x""
on the upper right corner of the assembly window.
Than you select the ""C"" editor section. If you single step now it will stay only in the
""C"" section and the assemblt window will stay close.
2. If this isn't the behaviour you expereince please do the following:
1. Highlight the project you are workign with.
2. Right click and select ""open containing folder""
3. Exit the IDE
4. In the project folder directory that is open rename the ""setting"" directory to ""setting.save""
5. Open the IDe again.

So it is so simple the resolution that worked for me: close the automatically popped-up disassembly, click in the source code window so cursor is blinking there, then step, and disassembly does not get re-popped-up. If I just dismiss the disassembly, it pops-up again on the next step.
............................................................
Set a breakpoint in the source code and run to it. Then you can step in the source code level.
............................................................
If you choose the the editor window (put your mouse on the editor window then left click) then single stepping is through the source code. However, if you choose the the disassembly window (put your mouse on the disassembly window then left click) then single stepping goes through every assembly instruction.

I copy a code from a pdf . it is similar with ""+-----+""

The strange thing is when it copied to Ultraedit or Textedit or Sublime (Mac notebook) the ""-"" would always not been shown.

By UE Hex mode, the binary is :C2 AD, and shown as a ""A with a ^ above"";
and if copied to IDEA, it would been shown correctly as ""+-----+"";
if in sublime ,it would disappear, just shown as ""++"".


But use javac to compile and run it ,two software would both print to file ""-"" at the same apperance.

The problem is :
Why same item copied to different software showned diff appearance? Is it the Software's coding setting diffs? but I checked IDEA and sublime and UE were all UTF-8.
",https://stackoverflow.com/questions/53819068/shown-diff-between-sublime-and-idea,"
The character UTF-8 encoded with C2 AD is a soft hyphen according to Unicode specification. A soft hyphen should be used only inside a word for the purpose of breaking words across lines by inserting visible hyphens.

Word processing applications like Microsoft Word do that. A soft hyphen can be inserted in MS Word by hitting Strg+- and should be used always instead of - (normal hyphen) on a word which needs to be broken at end of a line. When the line or the paragraph containing the line changes resulting in broken word no longer being at end of the line, the soft hyphen is no longer displayed and printed by the word processing application as hyphen.

The configured font defines how the soft hyphen character is displayed by a text editor like Sublime, Notepad++ or UltraEdit. Most fonts define this character without a glyph and so nothing is displayed on viewing a text with soft hyphen in a text editor.

IntelliJ IDEA uses either a different font than the other text editors or interprets a soft hyphen always or depending on context like a hyphen and map the character to U+002D.

The usage of soft hyphens between two plus signs is definitely a wrong usage of soft hyphens.

Not sure if this is even possible. 

I use Rstudio and appreciate having an overview of the objects I'm working with in the Global Environment pane. 

However, at the same time, I have some 15 or so simple wrapper functions that are specific to my project, e.g. on various reading and writing functions so that they automate some file management tasks and follow my preferred folder structure; unfortunately, they also clutter that GE view.

I guess I could put them all in a package but I'm quite sure I will not publish it and may not even need many of them beyond this one project.

Is there anything short of bundling them into a package for this kind of three-line functions?

You could always put them into a list:

helper_functions <- list(f1 = function1,
 f2 = function2)


Then you can call them by helper_functions$f2().

Example:

plus_one <- function(n){
return(n + 1)
}

plus_two <- function(n){
return(n + 2)
}


plus <- list(one = plus_one,
 two = plus_two)

plus$two(2)

Usually you have to import projects to meaningfully use your files. 

Otherwise, you just get a, for example, .java or .class file that you cannot do anything. 

If you are importing an existing project, check this link: https://www.360logica.com/blog/how-to-import-a-java-project-into-eclipse-ide/

Another option is, copying and pasting your existing file in the workplace folder that eclipse points to. Then go into eclipse and create a new project with the exact same name. At this point, eclipse should recognize the project and show it in the left project explorer window.

Remove the comma after the for loop, i'm surprised you are not gettingsyntax error from that. I'm not sure what you need a for loop there in the first place. If you want to iterate over each of the values that return from findContours do that after you have assigned the values to a variable. It looks like you don't pass the image as one of the values to unpack. Try rewriting the line as follows:
From the docs

contours, hierarchy = cv2.findContours(erosion,cv2.RETR_TREE,cv2.CHAIN_APPROX_NONE)


Assuming erosion is the name of the image. The reason why you are getting that error is because you are assigning 3 variables to a function and only outputs 2 (contours and the hierarchy). So python is expecting 3 outputs from findContours but only returning two, thus leading to the error you are getting.

There's an IntelliJ command named exactly like my title: Generate Sources and Update Folders For All Projects. What does that do? I might have did a huge mistake by clicking on it before asking what that does. It's now running for more than half an hour. Wont stop and I'm too afraid to stop it.

What I wanted to do is switching to another GIT branch, but the workspace crapped itself and resulted in some build errors, so I thought I would click on everything that looks like a recycle icon. So I pressed this one on the maven panel: .

Does it do anything special? It clearly works much longer than an

mvn clean install -DskipTests


What anything other would I need? Actually until now I didn't even need anything other than that.

ps. (It has finished now, but I'm still curious what that functionality really is.)
",https://stackoverflow.com/questions/54868822/generate-sources-and-update-folders-for-all-projects,"
The thing about generating sources is that its both a pre-build task (so that IntelliJ can access those generated sources for linting etc), and a build task (because these sources are not in source control and need to be generated with each build).
So IntelliJ has this button to Generate sources and Update Folders while Maven has a generate-sources phase in its default lifecycle. They ALMOST do the same thing.
Whether sources have been generated or not, IntelliJ needs to know where to import from. You can set that here
File | Settings | Build, Execution, Deployment | Build Tools | Maven | Importing
When you build your project, Maven generates the sources, but IntelliJ still doesn't know that it should import them. That's why the button has two actions in one. Alternatively, you can right-click your target/generated-sources directory and select ""Mark directory as > Generated sources root"". It should turn blue. But using the button is better, since it will use any custom directories configured in your source-generating plugin (provided your imports are configured to ""detect automatically"").
The Generate Sources and Update Folders action doesn't appear in the Build Output or Event log, but it will show briefly in the Background Tasks window. If you want to see what it did, open your version of my ~/.cache/JetBrains/IdeaIE2021.1/log/idea.log file. IntelliJ appears to invoke the source-generating plugin directly (outside a lifecycle).
Note these open issues though:

https://youtrack.jetbrains.com/issue/IDEA-90730
https://youtrack.jetbrains.com/issue/IDEA-252499

............................................................
Per the IntelliJ IDEA Maven FAQ:


In order to get generated sources automatically imported as source
folders configure corresponding plugins so that they put them into
target/generated-sources/, where subdir is any folder name you
prefer. The subdir folder is necessary to distinguish sources from
different tools and also to exclude some special generated sources
(e.g. groovy stubs).

Please note that even if you manually configure some source folders
under target/generated-sources of this folder itself, IDEA will
rewrite them according to your pom.xml.

Any time you want to generate sources you simply execute the
corresponding goal, bound for generation (usually generate-sources,
generate-test-sources). After that IDEA will pick up new folders and
set them up.


Per Maven docs:


Let's run though a short example to try and help. To generate sources
you must first have a plugin that participates in the generate-sources
phase like the ANTLR4 Maven Plugin.

So this is all fine and dandy, we have a plugin that wants to generate
some sources from a Antlr4 grammar but how do we use it. You need to
specify that you want to use it in your POM: If you then type mvn
compile Maven will walk through the lifecycle and will eventually hit
the generate-sources phase and see you have a plugin configured that
wants to participate in that phase and the ANTLR4 Maven Plugin is
executed with your given configuration. Furthermore during the compile
you can observe that all the generated code (from your grammar files)
will automatically being compiled without supplemental configuration.


As you can see Generate Sources action runs the generate-sources Maven phase for any plug-ins in your pom.xml that do generate any sources.

class Foo

public function bar(): \stdClass

When doing $foo = new Foo;, is it possible to annotate Phpdoc so that the IDE can autocomplete to $foo->bar()->test?
",https://stackoverflow.com/questions/54382117/annonate-fields-created-in-a-stdclass,"
I'm sorry, there's currently no way to document associative arrays or stdClass objects in phpDocumentor or custom annotations formats understood by NetBeans.

From a design perspective, perhaps it could make sense to use proper classes:

class Bar
{
/**
 * @var string
 */
public $test;
}

class Foo
{
public function bar(): Bar
{
$obj = new Bar;
$obj->test = 'test';
return $obj;
}
}


If you need no logic at all, the classes can be empty:

/**
 * @property string $test
 */
class Bar
{
}


Otherwise, you can always trick the IDE with a stub file that defines a fake class but is never actually executed and then pretend that your variable belongs to that class:

$foo = new Foo;
/* @var $bar Bar *//** @var Bar $bar */
$bar = $foo->bar();
$bar->…


… where /* @var $bar Bar */ is for NetBeans 8 and earlier and /** @var Bar $bar */ for NetBeans 10 (and many other IDEs).

(I can work around this but I am curious as to why it happens.)

I have the standard installation of Python on Windows 10. I also have the Anaconda package installed.

I noticed that when I started IDLE from the start menu it launched thus

Python 3.6.0 (v3.6.0:41df79263a11, Dec 23 2016, 07:18:10) [MSC v.1900 32 bit (Intel)] on win32


Yet when I go to the actual folder the link points to, and open idle.pyw it starts thus

Python 3.6.5 |Anaconda, Inc.| (default, Mar 29 2018, 13:32:41) [MSC v.1900 64 bit (AMD64)] on win32


Strange...

What exactly is causing it to start in these different ways?

The only way I can open the Python 3.6.0 is now through the start menu link - how could I launch 3.6.0 without having to go through the start menu?
",https://stackoverflow.com/questions/52604739/idle-python-ide-launches-differently-when-opened-from-start-menu-link-than-from,"
Either you have misinterpreted something or there is something strange in the registry.In either case, once you have the 32-bit 3.6.0 open, you can right click on the icon in the taskbar and click 'Pin to taskbar'.Or, you can drag and drop the Start Menu icon to the desktop.Either way, I recommend upgrading to 3.6.6 now or 3.6.7 in a week or so.

I have a apache spark standalone cluster and I want to run spark's job on it from remote computer via IDE (Eclipse or IntelliJ). When I create a jar file and send it to master and run it with spark-submit, every thing is ok, but in IDE, I can not run the job. There isn't any errors in output but I think Executors are created and killed repeatedly and this infinite loop continue until I kill the job. Part of the job's output is given below.

So, my question is What is the problem and how can I fix that? 
(OS in Cluster machines=ubuntu,OS in remote machine=Windows,Hadoop version in all machines=2.7.6,spark version in all machines=2.3). Also, I can see Spark,hadoop,HDFS UIs in my remote machine

I have fixed your issue. In System.out.println() at line 70 and 104 , you have used the variable without using +variable + with it since it was not able to recognise it.

First of all once you declare the variable you should not declare them back. as example from your code;

int cookies;
int cookies = in.nextInt();


This variable declaration and initialization is wrong and it should be change like this;

int cookies;
cookies = in.nextInt();


next when you call a method pass the parameters also, as example;

makeTheDough(oven);


also in java you cannot use declared variables without initializing. in your code all the method print statements not work because of that and loose of the proper format.( use + for string concatenation.)

Also careful about your code flow and carefully separate blocks by using {}.

According to your code, working code as follow.

import java.util.Scanner;

public class BakingCookies{
public static void main (String [] args) {
int cookies;
int ovenTemp;
int cookTime;

cookies = in.nextInt();

",https://stackoverflow.com/questions/53089773/pycharm-thinks-im-using-python-3-5-but-im-using-3-7,"
This means that the inspections check for code compatibility with Python 3.5.

To modify this go to File -> Settings -> Editor -> Inspections -> Python -> Code compatibility inspection When you click on that latter line, on the bottom right of the window is the list on compatibility checks you can have. You can tick or untick the Python versions you want.

I've looked at adobe-brackets and atom-editor, the remote branches don't show up in the side panel when choosing to switch to them. They show up if I choose to pull from another branch. I tried git fetch --all and several other commands, the branches show up when listing them, just not in the side pane here. (Or in Atom). I've noticed that if I create a new branch and use the same branch as the origin that it seems to work but this seems like a dirty hack and I'm not sure that it's the correct way to do it.


",https://stackoverflow.com/questions/50537424/remote-git-branches-not-showing-up-in-ide,"
This behavior is expected. Usually a git GUI only lists the branches existing in your local repo, not all the branches existing in the remote repo.

A remote branch is just that, a remote branch. While you can check it out, you don't want to work on a remote branch directly (i.e. commit to it directly). Rather, you want to create a local branch tracking it, and work on the local branch - just like how you did to make it ""work"". It's not a dirty hack. Welcome to the club of normal git users. :-)

First of all, it's all about maximizing the productivity as a c++ programmer. My regular work is to use Windows ssh client such as xshell to log in to remote linux machine via ssh and do many linux work there. Imagine I want to set up a big C++ project, and now I'm faced with a trouble.


If I write code in Windows IDE, I need to propagate the changes every time I modify some files to linux machine, and compile there. (Consider compiling in Windows is not feasible or very slow)
If I write code in linux terminal, as it's gonna be a big project(not just a simple hellowrold), the productivity in working on vim or emacs cannot match withthat in Windows IDE.


Here I want to exclude some options such as samba, configuring many plugins for vim, or just buy a Mac. And if I write in Windows, it's undesirable to copy the whole contents to remote machine every time syncing with it.

Any ways or tools to make this process easier and productive ?
",https://stackoverflow.com/questions/54327773/efficient-method-of-writing-c-code-in-windows-ide-and-compiling-in-linux-termi,"
I just use VirtualBox:


Create a VM containing your favorite flavor of Linux
Create a project in your Windows IDE of choice - I use VS2015 at the mo.
Set the VS project directory as an external mount point/shared folder of the VM. So all code changes are intrinsically available to the Linux machine.
When its time to compile just alt-tab to the VM windows and type make (assuming you've create your MakeFile ;) )

............................................................
Here are some options:


Option 1: Use mobaxterm (which is a very fast xserver on windows) to run your IDE. I run Qt Creator over the internet and it's instantaneous, so no lags.
Option 2: Use VNC only for that program. So create some VNC server and run your IDE in it. This doesn't work for me because the VNC server (realvnc I think) crashes all the time. Maybe you'll be lucky.
Option 3: Use VNC with desktop environment. I got this to work at work, but not at home. It depends on what desktop environment you want to use, something like icewm is fine (the command on linux is vncserver for that).
Option 4: Use X2Go as your remote environment. Install the server on your linux, and connect to it with ssh.
Option 5: Use xrdp protocol. Install it on linux, and use windows remote desktop to connect to your linux machine from windows.


Warning: If you're using VNC, be aware that the standard VNC implementation doesn't provide encrypted connection. So you should use something like ssh tunnel (with putty, or similar) from Windows to Linux, then tunnel your VNC connection through it.
............................................................
Here is how I work in this situation:


setup a distant Git repo
use your regular workstation to edit your code (Windows OS), using the IDE that suits you needs
keep a shell open on your remote Linux machine (SSH)
As soon as you have something runnable/testable:


commit your changes and git push
in your Linux Shell: git pull & build (make ?)

Im learn apache-flink but not able to setup a scala IDE for it.
I’m using ubuntu 16 os and I have gone through every page in google search. 
Seems like everyone is working on java not scala.
How can i do this?
Thanks in advance 
",https://stackoverflow.com/questions/53694515/how-do-i-setup-scala-ide-for-apache-flink,"
The high-level advice is to use IntelliJ, not Eclipse, for Scala development with Flink. With IntelliJ, install the scala plugin from Jetbrains, and add a Scala SDK in the Global Libraries section of project structure dialog.

I haven't able to get Eclipse to do mixed Java/Scala development.
............................................................
It's funny to answer my own question.
IntelliJ seems cumbersome for me so I decided to use traditional eclipse.
So I downloaded scala eclipse from here 
http://scala-ide.org/
then downloaded flink manually from here https://flink.apache.org/downloads.html
Open eclipse and create a project then right click on project then click on properties and go to java build path; then go to libraries tab and click on add External Jars.
Add all the jar files in the flink folder
flink-1.7.0-bin-hadoop28-scala_2.11/flink-1.7.0/opt/
Now you are good to go !

I want to test the language server protocoll in a simple self written text editor. But I am not quite sure if I understand correctly how to write to the server and read from it. I want to do this in C++. 

For testing purpose I use Qt in this example. But if you use another library this is okay too. As a server I installed ccls (it is working as I tested it with atom).

So this was my generel idea:
1. Start server as a process
2. Define a json file for the initialization according to the specification
3. Convert it into a String and sent it to the client
3. Wait for a response (Which should be an InitializeResult)

#include <QCoreApplication>
#include <QProcess>
#include <iostream>
#include <QFile>

int main(int argc, char* argv[]) {
QCoreApplication app(argc, argv);

QFile file {""src/initializeRequest.json""};
file.open(QIODevice::ReadOnly);

QProcess* myProcess = new QProcess(&app);
myProcess->start(""ccls"", QStringList {});

std::cout << myProcess->write(file.readAll()) << '\n';
std::cout << myProcess->readAll().toStdString();
file.close();
return app.exec();
}


But actually I am not even sure if those messages (didOpen,initialzeRequest etc.) are really sent as files. According to the language server protocoll website they are interfaces descirbing a json file ... but I didn't find anything about how they are sent 

So I would appreciate if any can tell me if I am on the right track (with my attempt to send actual files) and if anyone could show me the most simple communication to the server, so I actually get a response (to see if it works). 
",https://stackoverflow.com/questions/54276556/communicate-with-language-server-languager-server-protocoll,"
I experimented a lot and created a minimal working example. In this example I send an initialize request to ccls (which is a C++ language server) and read the response. 
I used QProcess for starting the server (but of course one can use something different) and rapidjson (https://github.com/Tencent/rapidjson) for the construction of the json file. 

#include <QCoreApplication>
#include <QProcess>
#include <iostream>
#include <sstream>

#include ""rapidjson/stringbuffer.h""
#include ""rapidjson/writer.h""

int main(int argc, char* argv[]) {
QCoreApplication app {argc, argv};

//Start server as a QProcess
QProcess* server = new QProcess {&app};
server->start(""ccls"", QStringList {""-log-file=/tmp/ccls2.log"", ""-init={}""});
server->waitForStarted(-1);
std::cout << ""Server started"" << '\n';

//Construct json Request
rapidjson::StringBuffer output {};
rapidjson::Writer<rapidjson::StringBuffer> writer {output};

writer.StartObject();
writer.Key(""jsonrpc"");
writer.String(""2.0"");
writer.Key(""id"");
writer.Int(0);
writer.Key(""method"");
writer.String(""initialize"");
writer.Key(""params"");
writer.StartObject();
writer.Key(""processId"");
writer.Int(0);
writer.Key(""rootUri"");
writer.String(""home"");
writer.Key(""capabilities"");
writer.StartObject();
writer.EndObject();
writer.EndObject();
writer.EndObject();

std::string content = output.GetString();
std::ostringstream oss;
oss << ""Content-Length: "" << content.length() << ""\r\n"" << ""\r\n"";
std::string header = oss.str();

std::cout << header << content << '\n';

//Send request to server
server->write(header.c_str());
server->write(content.c_str());

//Wait for response and read it
server->waitForReadyRead(-1);
std::cout << ""Server has sent response"" << '\n';
std::cout << server->readAll().toStdString() << '\n';

return app.exec();
}


And the output: 

Server started
Content-Length: 106

{""jsonrpc"":""2.0"",""id"":0,""method"":""initialize"",""params"":{""processId"":0,""rootUri"":""home"",""capabilities"":{}}}

As I said I wanted to show everyone who has the same question a minimal working example. Of course it makes sense to create structs for Request etc.

I am working in the JetBrains PhpStorm IDE and I use the ""Mark directory as"" to mark my public resource folder.
This is working perfect with the public resources.

I was wondering if thats also possible for my App views, I already marked my ""views"" directory as Resource but that didn't do anything.

So to be clear I mean, Now I have to type the path myself 
I want the path to autocomplete with the views directory as the root

protected function view($view, $data = [])
{
require_once ""../app/views/"" . $view . "".php"";
}


$this->view(""path/to/my/views"");

I am struggling to find information on this. Of course certain features such as docker and hyper-v will not function, but will Visual Studio 2017 be able to be installed and run on a Windows 10 always-connected ARM device? Like, would typical desktop/web development scenarios with .NET/C++/Python work?

Cheers.

Yes, it is possible. I just got a Asus Nova Go and tried it. Compiling and running a basic .net Core app (with an Avalonia UI) worked just fine but there are some limitations and corner cases that hopefully will get fixed.

Visual Studio takes long to launch, and when lauched is not very performant.

I think the Lenovo Yoga C630 is snappier, because of the bigger 8GB RAM and the Snapdragon 850.

VS code likes thinking for me, which is the number 1 sin a text editor can 
do. To ""help"" it will auto type [] and {}, when deleting it will also delete [] instead of just ]. When typing HTML it also tries to auto add </div> at the wrong time...

99% of the time when it adds a character I didn't add myself it creates issues. How can I turn that feature off? i.e if I didn't explicitly press a key to modify a character, VS code has no business touching that character.

Normally, using cmd+shift+f will launch PhpStorm's ""Find in Path..."" feature, and the search text defaults to whatever text is highlighted in the IDE. For me, it defaults to what is highlighted for a fraction of a second, before being replaced with this code:

2223 2BC9 EA71 DED7 8AAE DB73 C773 21A0 E816 78AE

I am not sure what this code represents but it is always the same. I have to delete and re-type or paste the content I want to search in order to continue with my search. The next time I open the ""Find in Path"" dialog, it happens again. 

Does anyone have any clue what this might mean?

I've used AppCode (Intellij C++/ObjC IDE that replaces Xcode) for a while and really gotten used to being able to Ctrl+Click on any identifier to get to its definition/decleration.

Now on a new work place, I'm using CLion for a somewhat larger code base and Ctrl+Click hardly ever works. It only seem to work when the identifier is in the same file.

Is there anything I need to setup for this to work correctly? CLion seem to index the code successfully and doing text searches works fine.
",https://stackoverflow.com/questions/50923700/clion-code-navigation-with-c-doesnt-work,"
You need to use import project functionality of CLion from File -> Import Project and give ok for CMakeLists.txt file automatic creation. Never mind the file is for CMake, you can build your project with other tools too, but CLion uses it for the dependencies.

Then append in the beginning of that file a line stating:

include_directories(.)


After that go to File -> Settings and there search for Keymap from the left and after that on right, right below the word ""keymap"" there is a selection element for taking for example Eclipse default keymapping in use and there you have at least (I tested only it) the ctrl + click functionality working like charm!!

kudos about the include_directories(.) goes to this question: CLion indexer does not resolve some includes in the project directory

Youneed topress ctrl + alt + shift + n.

And after pressing it a dialog box will appear to enter your variable/function name and click enter.
Tip: Filter the result for a better experience. Filter option is present on right side of the dialog box.


To get a quick peek of function/variable definition press ctrl + q while focusing on the variable or function.


To get the detailed or full definition of function press ctrl + shift + i while focusing on the variable or function.
............................................................
I just looked at one of my more complicated teaching examples with multiple header/source files where this would come up. 

What I see is that ctl-click (and the red/green arrows in the gutter) does work only in the same file. But I can right-click on a method from another file and choose to go to either the declaration (in header) or definition (in cpp). 

The hotkeys to do this are not ctl-click. But you can remap hotkeys in IntelliJ ides, so you may be able to come up with hotkey combinations that don't seem too awkward to you.
............................................................
What helped me was to run File > New CMake Project from Sources
Until that point, Ctrl+click in CLion would go to the definitions, but wouldn't find any usages.

So, I have to build an IDE inside Unity 3D. So far I made a canvas, panel, input field, image and a text on the image. So... my question is how to dynamically show the line numbers on the left side?

Make sure your input field's line type is set as 'Multiline New Line'. Get the text from OnValueChanged event of your input field. Split the string by '\n'. You will get the array of lines. The length of that array is number of lines in your input field. Add 1 to that length value & use it as your last line number.

I'm using Ubuntu 16.04 LTS.
My computer has 2 disks, SSD 256GB, 1TB HDD.
And I partitioned that like following

- SSD Area
/boot 500MB
swap16GB
/ Rest of SSD

- HDD Area
/home Whole HDD


Now my IDE and Workspace are loacated in /home directory.
I think it's not good to use disk efficiently.

I guess I have to move my IDE and Workspace to not /home directory.
When I move them to SSD area, I could use it faster.
Right?

So if this is right, where I supposed to move them?
Is there any location you recommend?
",https://stackoverflow.com/questions/50463982/where-do-you-locate-your-ide-or-workspace,"
On a Linux os, you would install user applications to /opt. This is ideal in your case as it will be on your SSD. 
It is good practice to store data and files in your home directory so that would be a good place for your workspace directory.

When there's an error in a file, IntelliJ underlines the relevant code in red and marks the position of the error in red on the right-hand side of the editor, e.g.



Is there some way that I can get a list of all errors in a module? I know IntelliJ has a ""Problems"" view, but I can't seem to display it, and I'm pretty sure low-level errors like this aren't shown in it anyway (IIRC it only shows project-wide problems such as missing dependencies).

In my case the module is a Grails app, so it contains both server-side (Groovy) code and front-end code (JS, HTML, CSS, etc.). If I run ""Build Project"" (or ""Build Module"") any errors in the JS code aren't listed in the output, presumably because JS code doesn't have to be built (compiled).

I've been having trouble writing a conditional if statement that compares one entry of an array, to an initger value

the error is clear you are comparing an object triangleWcolor to a int:

 'operator<' (operand types are 'triangleWcolor' and 'int')


If triangleWcolor is an enum, you could maybe try a static_cast on it, but you should be sure this is still meaningful (enum values are contiguous)

You cannot compare a structure to an int without converting it. 

if you don't want to convert it then i suggest creating an int in your structure and compare those two ints together.

I'm using Strawberry Prolog and when I write

?- write('Hello World'),nl.


it outputs HelloWorld without whitespace but if I change the single quote to a double quote it outputs everything fine why is that?And why is this not a problem with other prolog IDE's?Also why is there a difference between single and double quotes?

Finally if it's no trouble can someone recommend a some guides on prolog?
",https://stackoverflow.com/questions/50454187/why-does-strawberry-prolog-ignore-whitespaces,"
A good check point, for what a Prolog system should do, is always GNU Prolog (for some issues version 1.3.0 is even better). It is very close to the ISO core standard, and doesn't have a lot of novelties. So you should get something along:

GNU Prolog 1.4.4 (64 bits)
Compiled Apr 23 2013, 16:05:07 with cl

?- write('Hello World'), nl.
Hello World

yes
?- write(""Hello World""), nl.
[72,101,108,108,111,32,87,111,114,108,100]


Explanation 1 Single Quotes: 


The write/1 predicate should write
atoms unquoted. Which means atoms that usually need quotes, will be
written without quotes. If you want to show quotes you can use
writeq/1. And atom is in single quotes.


Explanation 2 Double Quotes:


Double quotes were traditionally used
to denote lists of character codes, so that one can easily define DCG
rules. A lot of Prolog systems divert here, and even the ISO core
standard allows character atoms instead codes.


But usually you can ask the Prolog system what it does with double quotes, and even modify the behaviour. Just use the Prolog flag double_quotes. Here is what you can do in GNU-Prolog:

?- current_prolog_flag(double_quotes, X).
X = codes

?- set_prolog_flag(double_quotes, chars).
yes

?- write(""Hello World""), nl.
[H,e,l,l,o, ,W,o,r,l,d]

So, I worked with VSC earlier, no problem whatsoever. Then it didn't work anymore, something about node not being found in PATH

I've written programs in several languages and have tutored students in computer science, but just starting to learn Java on my MacBook. Regarding this question, I'd be happy with any answer that points me to available information or tutorials that address my question; I'm capable of understanding advanced things. 

I've been searching for the right IDE for me as well as something I can use with my students, and I've tried IntelliJ, Eclipse, and VS Code. Along the way I've installed external JARs to provide extra capabilities, such as Apache Commons.

Things are getting confusing. I've lost track of how I got to the present state in each IDE. I'd like to understand better how to know the overall Java environment that any given project is using on each of these IDEs, including any external JARs and where they are located. And I'd like to know if they borrow from the Java system environment. 

My goal is to understand how my own system got to the way its currently configured, to update my configuration on a project-by-project basis, and to help my students get a matching configuration.

I'd also like advice on the right way, or simplest/cleanest way, to install external JARs.

Maven


Question: I'd also like advice on the right way, or simplest/cleanest way, to install external JARs.


If you really wanna work in a organised way and wanna focus completely on coding rather than looking for dependencies to work with , then try building your projects with Apache Maven. The magic wand of Maven projects are pom.xml file where all magic happens depending upon your wish.

Maven is a build automation tool used primarily for Java projects. Maven addresses two aspects of building software: 


Describes and manages how software is built.
Describes and manages dependencies (various libraries used by your code).


Why Maven:


De facto standard
Able to compile, test, pack and distribute source code ( different Goals)
Robust dependency management (Most important from my point of view)
Extensible via plugin
Good community support and many fan boys around.
The big 3 IDEs (IntelliJ, NetBeans, and Eclipse) all having good
support for Maven, letting you use Maven as a substitute for their
own proprietary project definition and build process. 
Maven famously caches all of its dependencies in the ~/.m2
directory, which is sometimes called the local Maven repository.
Maven local repository keeps your project's all dependencies (library jars, 
plugin jars etc.). When you run a Maven build, then Maven automatically 
downloads all the dependency jars into the local repository. It helps to 
avoid references to dependencies stored on remote machine every time a 
project is build. 


You can simply deploy your project as JAR, WAR, or EAR file and use it on different IDEs or as standalone.
............................................................
All IDEs need a way to know your project's dependencies. You can either tell them that yourself or let a build tool do that.

Manual dependency handling: by adding the jars to your project. This is probably the fastest way when working on a small project, with one developer, on a specific IDE, with few dependencies. Usually when telling the IDE that this .jar is a dependency of your project, the IDE stores that reference to a project-specific file (eg. in Eclipse the .classpath file which you can edit with a txt editor and see the dependencies yourself). However, it kind of locks your application to your IDE. Most IDEs have cross-IDE support for import and migration, but using both IDEs at the same time can be confusing when a dependency is added to one and has to be repetitively added to other as well. Furthermore, your dependencies have dependencies on their own. By adding manually your jars you are responsible to find and download their owndependencies as well.

Use a build tool: There are 3 standard such tools right now: Apache Ant with Ivy, Apache Maven and Gradle. All of them have support in the major IDEs for Java: IntelliJ IDEA, Eclipse and NetBeans. All of them use some extra build-tool specific files to store your project's configuration and subsequently configure your IDE and the IDE-specific files. That way, your project becomes IDE-agnostic, the IDE outsources the dependency handling to the build tool. These tools will download any direct or transitive dependencies of your project in a local directory or you can compile jars in a specified folder. From those, Ant is the oldest (with Ivy adding dependency handling support), Maven was developed after that and Gradle is the newest and probably the most flexible. In production however Maven is by far the most established one right now.
It would be also useful to look up the Standard Directory Layout. If you adhere to that, it will be easier to work/start with either Maven or Gradle.

Finally, you can search and find most of the free libraries in Maven-Central where conveniently their Ivy/Maven/Gradle script is added as well for you to use on your build-tool script. In many cases a .jar is provided as well if you prefer to manually add it as a dependency.

Regarding VS Code, I think it supports these tools through plugins but I'm not sure.

Several developers on my team have this problem. We can run our app in the IDE fine, but when we eventually quit the app, the IDE itself will then crash.

The crash takes the form of 


""Visual Basic has stopped working""




It doesn't matter if we quit our app nicely or force-stop it in the debugger; same result (crashed IDE).



The exit sequence for the app is:


User selects 'exit' from a menu 
Menu event handler calls Unload Me
Form_QueryUnload event handler fires
Form_Unload event handler fires. It does: 


 

'close all sub forms
For i = Forms.Count - 1 To 1 Step -1
Unload Forms(i)
Next


Then saves some data and then does Exit Sub.



We tend to run a group file with a 5-6 projects in it.

This error sometimes seems to go away, other times it occurs, seemingly randomly. I don't know what factor influences this.

If we don't actually run the app, just the IDE, then it works fine and we can quit the IDE itself normally.

Anyone seen this before? Any ideas? Thanks!
",https://stackoverflow.com/questions/52994814/vb6-ide-crashes-after-application-terminates,"
This is most definately caused by leaks of VB6 objects that are involved in subclassing/hooking and not only these.

What we did to get rid of these crashes was to instrument all of our classes (including forms, user controls, designers and anything that can be instantiated) with DebugInstanceInit and DebugInstanceTerm calls in respective Class/Form/UserControl Initialize and Terminate events. 

Public Sub DebugInstanceInit(sModuleName As String, sDebugID As String, oObj As Object)

Public Sub DebugInstanceTerm(sModuleName As String, sDebugID As String)


These basicly track at any time how many and what kind of instances the application is using. Each instance is assigned a unique sDebugID in DebugInstanceInit that is used as a key in DebugIDs collection. This collection is instantiated empty in Sub Main and when application teminates (i.e. in main form's Form_Unload) this collection has to be empty or with a fixed number of instances left (for instance exactly 4) otherwise its content is the kind of objects we are leaking.

What fixed the IDE crashes?

Notice the collection is instantiated as late as Sub Main which means it has to remain Nothing at design-time. We just put a simple check in DebugInstanceInit like this

If DebugIDs Is Nothing Then
If Left$(sModuleName, 3) <> ""ctx"" Then
DebugPrint ""DebugInstanceInit"", ""mdErrorHandling"", sDebugID & "" "" & LIB_NAME & ""."" & sModuleName & ""."" & FUNC_NAME_INITIALIZE & "" (This should not happen)""
End If
Else
 ...
End If


Basicly this prevented anything other than raw UserControls placed on forms from being instantiated at design-time. This includes GlobalMultiUse objects, this includes anything UC properties are accessing as UC properties are kind of routines that are certainly accessed at design-time. 

So we had to sprinkle most of the UC's code heavily with Ambient.UserMode checks like this

If Ambient.UserMode Then
Set .Picture = LoadStdPicture(ucsPicHelp)
End If

I believe another answer is correct in its technical assessment of the cause of the problem. But it may also be useful to briefly describe the procedure I used to narrow down the source lines of code. In my case this problem appeared to be TOTALLY random, so it was hard to know where to start.

My approach was not rocket science - more brute force. Essentially I used a binary search to rule in/out sections of code. First step was to comment out the entire startup procedure so that the app would start as an empty shell; this demonstrated that the problem went away (null result).

Following that I recursively commented in roughly half the code, testing for the problem each time. Each block was evaluated as a boolean - it either did or did not cause the problem. Then proceed again in the block not ruled out.

Eventually (and more quickly than I anticipated) this led to a single line of code which accessed a property of a third-party control.

I am starting to use Omnet++ with veins for VANET simulations, but at the end of the tutorial (http://veins.car2x.org/tutorial/), where it says to go into the IDE and click ""Run As > OMNeT++ simulation"", 

an error occured : 


Cannot evaluate parameter 'headerLength': (omnetpp::cDoubleParImpl)headerLength: Cannot cast from type double to integer - in module (Mac1609_4) RSUEXAMPLESCENARIO.rsu[0].nic.mac1609_4 (id=12), during network initialization.


Ok, it crash trying to cast int from double, but i don't know where and i can't fix that! 

Thanks for answers
",https://stackoverflow.com/questions/50366328/error-in-veins-tutorial-simulation,"
This has already been answered here : Error while running example of the veins in the last step of the installation

It was fixed in this commit. You can downgrade omnet++ as @Christoph Sommer suggested or you can try this workaround if you wanna stick to the last version.
It should work since I had the same exact problem (using a recent version of omnet++).

I am working on a Django project using React for some aspects and seeing that I have licenses for both WebStorm and PyCharm, I would like to use both. 

If I open them simultaneously, they keep having to reload the project. More specifically every time one of the IDEs receives focus, it prompts me to reload the project iff, the other IDE received focus since the last window switch. 
I suspect this is because they are using the same folder (i.e. {project_root}/.idea) to store there cache/shelved changes etc.

Were can I change the setting, where these infos are stored in order to allow both IDEs to function alongside each other?
",https://stackoverflow.com/questions/53592343/how-do-i-use-pycharm-and-webstorm-in-the-same-project-simultaneously,"
Idea-based IDEs (WebStorm, PyCharm, PHPStorm, IDEA, etc) have the same project format (.idea) but different settings/module types that aren't always compatible, plus each IDE needs to write its stuff to project files (for example, .idea/workspace.xml is updated each time you open editor tab, etc., as information about recently opened files, cursor positions, etc. is stored there), so having the project opened in 2 IDEs at the same time will cause such issues.
If you like to work on the same sources in different IDEs, I'd suggest sharing the sources folder(s) but keeping the .idea folders separated: just create a new empty WebStorm project in preferred WebStorm-specific location and add your shared sources root as additional content root to it in Settings | Directories, Add Content root. Same thing should be done for PyCharm. As a result, you will have IDE-specific .idea folders and shared sources

I was recently reading a java class where the person had created methods via IDE shortcut( extract method shortcut ). All methods had a return type of void and what was supposed to be return type was passed as input parameter for the method. Below is an example of what i'm referring to.

public void multiply(Integer first, Integer second, Integer result){
 result = first * second;
}


I was wondering if the above is a good way of doing things. I personally do not like the above way of creating methods. I think the method should have been like below. 

public Integer multiply(Integer first, Integer second, Integer result){
 return first * second;
}


But in IntelliJ/Eclipse when we do extract method mostly creates method like above.

Can someone please let me know why IDE's usually create void method when we use the extract method shortcut and is the 1st style of method definition a good practice at all?
",https://stackoverflow.com/questions/52974248/reason-for-java-ide-generating-methods-with-void-return-type-when-extract-method,"
If the method being called isn't being assigned to a variable, Eclipse has no way to know what the return value is supposed to be.

Presumably, the original code looked something like this:

 public static void main(String args[]){
 Integer result = 0;
 multiply(1,3,result);
 }


There's no way for Eclipse to divine that multiply is supposed to return anything, so it defaults to void. If you want to infer return values, have it be assigned to a variable like so:

 public static void main(String args[]){
 Integer result = 0;
 result = multiply(1,3,result);
 }

I get that Canopy ""is its own ecosystem"" as my friend told me (when he explained to me that I didn't have Python on my computer and that's why my command line instructions weren't doing anything). Could this be the reason that it takes longer to load than Eclipse, which (I guess) I downloaded separately from Java? Or is it some other reason?
",https://stackoverflow.com/questions/53549688/why-does-eclipse-load-faster-than-canopy,"
Good question! Fast loading was not a design goal of Canopy. Most Canopy users leave it open for many hours at a time, so load time (while always nice, of course!) was not as high a priority as having it include a robust scientific Python distribution. The technical reason why it loads slowly (especially when the OS's cache is ""cold"") is that it opens and interprets many tens of Python modules, some quite complex. Unlike C, Python is usually not compiled, so the startup time of Python programs is typically slower, though when important, there are ways to counteract that.

I have a parent class P with subclasses A and B.

I would like to find all usages of a method f of A.

So either p.f() or a.f() but not b.f(), because an instance B b cannot call A.f.

I know I can find


Calls directly to A.f. This misses:

P p = new A();
p.f();

Calls to P.f and any override. This has too many false positives.


I know there are always going to be false positives using only compile-time information, but there could be fewer.
",https://stackoverflow.com/questions/53186563/intellij-idea-find-usages-of-overriding-method-without-finding-sibling-methods,"
You could use Structural Search (Edit | Find | Search Structurally...) for this. Use a query like:

$x$.f()


with expression type filter A|P. This will find all calls to f() on expressions of a type of either A or P. If you have any more classes in the hierarchy between A and P, you will need to add these to the expression type filter also.
............................................................
Now it's possible to search usages in more depth. Just hit Ctrl+Shift+Alt+F7 instead of Alt+F7 and check what you want to search for. In your case, uncheck 'Search for base method usages'.

I know how to jump to the next and previous error (F2, see SO Link, jetbrains.com), but is there a way to easily jump between suggestions?

If possible, I would really love to have a keyboard shortcut for this, as I am currently learning Kotlin and IntelliJ often has nice suggestions on how to improve the code.
If there is no keyboard shortcut to jump between suggestions, is there at least any other way?

With suggestion I mean things like the following (Ignore the ""nonsense code"")):


",https://stackoverflow.com/questions/51893767/intellij-keyboard-shortcut-to-jump-to-next-previous-suggestion,"
F2 also works to navigate between warnings. If there are errors in the file, it will jump to the next error. If not, it will jump to the next warning.
............................................................
Adding to yole's answer: if you want to jump backwards you can use Shift + F2 instead.

Additionally you can alter the severity of each inspection (or inspection group) using the settings menu File | Settings | Editor | Inspections or directly using the intention action context menu (ALT + ENTER or similar) when dealing with a highlighted element (be it warning, error, information, etc.).

Note that some inspections are not enabled by default and many allow customization to your needs (e.g. class naming conventions, etc.).

I did once increase the severity of all the inspections and switch them back one by one as needed or even turned many off (or switched them to ""weak warnings""), just to easily jump back and forth between them. I can't recommend that approach anymore ;-) (too many highlightings then... but it may help to find out about inspections you consider more helpful).

When I look at a Sass/ SCSS file in my project, it has a sea of 'orange' errors due to not recognising that the Sass statement in question depends on mix-ins/ variables declared in a separate partial file.

What should I be doing to get the IDE to recognise that such variables and mix-ins are declared in another partial file?

e.g.

_variables.scss
_mixins.scss
_partial1.scss<-- lots of warnings in here 
_partial2.scss<-- lots of warnings in here too
main.scss <-- @imports _variables, _mixins and _partial files.


Example tooltip from error:


",https://stackoverflow.com/questions/51879814/sass-linting-in-jetbrains-ides-idea-phpstorm-webstorm-etc,"
What errors can you see - 'unresolved' or 'resolved by name only'?
PhpStorm/IDEA use the following approach for elements resolving in SASS:


If element can be resolved to declaration from current file or from explicitly imported files, then it is just resolved
If element was not resolved after the first step (declaration is not found in current file/files explicitly imported into current file) then the IDE tries to resolve it just by name no matter which file it's declared in ('global' elements). Resolved element is marked by weak-warning inspection 'Resolved by name only', as the IDE can't know if this element is 'global' or just not imported by mistake. You can disable this inspection if you don't like to see these warnings.
If element still not resolved it is marked with warning 'Unresolved something'.

............................................................
There is 2 ways:


To be correct from PHPStorm point of view you need to import all dependencies for each particular file directly into it (as we do, for example, in JavaScript modules). This way, however, will result into CSS code bloating because in a case if your import will contain CSS code - it will be duplicated and it will not be solvable even by minifiers
To get rid of these errors you can just disable this particular inspection. Personally I prefer this way since ""Resolved only by name"" inspection is specific to SASS/SCSS and will not break similar inspections for other types of files.

Yes, using single ' or double "" quotes in python doesn't let you write a string longer than one line. If you want to write a multiline string, use triple-quotes:

'''Accept:*/*

Accept-Language:en-US,en;q=0.9

Alternatively you can use string concatenation methods. But then you'll have to write the linebreaks explicitly (which makes this method inferior if you plan to copy-paste):

request = (
'Accept:*/*\n'
'Accept-Encoding:gzip, deflate, br\n'
'Accept-Language:en-US,en;q=0.9\n'
'Connection:keep-alive\n'
...

Ruby isn't a statically-typed language, so it isn't really possible for a code completion engine to know exactly what type any function will return.

However, sometimes the programmer knows. Take the code below, which uses metaprogramming to 'confuse' code completion:

class Example
define_method :foo do
2 + 2
end

def bar
foo_result = foo
end
end


A static analyser doesn't know that foo exists, so it can't provide code completion for it. Even though foo will always be an Integer and we know that, I only get code completion for BasicObject.



Is there a way to tell a code completion engine which type I know something is going to be, so that I get better completion results, which is simply ignored by the interpreter?
",https://stackoverflow.com/questions/52210167/assert-type-for-code-completion-in-rubymine,"
Turns out this is partially possible using ""Annotations"" in the form of comments, which are documented at: https://www.jetbrains.com/help/ruby/using-annotations.html

You can add types to ambiguous methods or variables like this:

# @return [String]
def mystery_method
# @type [Integer]
foo = nil
end


It doesn't appear that you can create entirely new methods using this approach though, for example for metaprogramming-driven methods.

",https://stackoverflow.com/questions/51853032/rearrange-common-functions-in-specific-order-with-phpstorm,"
You need to put the rules before the method - by modifiers (default) one. 

This way, your methods will always come first and then PHPStorm will order the rest like it usually does. If they're at the end, all of the methods will already have been consumed by the default rule, so the remaining rules won't matter.

Also, you need to specify method as you did in your second example.

Then, using Rearrange Code should do it (I've just tested it).

If I understand what you are trying to achieve, i.e. load some data into memory once and use the same data (in memory) with multiple runs of your code, with possible modifications to that code, there is no such IDE, as IDE are not ment to store any data. 

What you can do is first load your data into some in-memory database and write your c++ program to read data from that database instead of reading it directly from data-source in C++.

how avoid multiple reads of big data set.
What kind of techniques do C++ users use for big data in order to read
the data ""once for all"" ?


I do not know of any C++ tool with such capabilities, but I doubt that I have ever searched for one ... seems like something you might do.Keywords appear to be 'data frame' and 'statistical analysis' (and C++).



If you know the 'data set' format, and wish to process raw data no more than one time, you might consider using Posix shared memory. 

I can imagine that (a) the 'extremely time consuming' effort could (read and) transform the 'raw' data, and write into a 'data set' (a file) suitable for future efforts (i.e. 'once and for all'). 

Then (b) future efforts can 'simply' ""map"" the created 'data set' (a file) into the program's memory space, all ready for use with no (or at least much reduced) time consuming effort.

Expanding the memory map of your program is about using 'Posix' access to shared memory. (Ubuntu 17.10 has it, I have 'gently' used it in C++)Terminology includes, shm_open, mmap, munmap, shm_unlink, and a few others.

From 'man mmap':


mmap()createsanew mapping in the virtual address space of the
calling process.The starting address for
 the new mapping is specified in ...

how avoid multiple reads of big data set. What kind of techniques do
C++ users use for big data in order to read the data ""once for all"" ?


I recently retried my hand at measuring std::thread context switch duration (on my Ubuntu 17.10, 64 bit desktop).My app captured <30 million entries over 10 seconds of measurement time.I also experimented with longer measurement times, and with larger captures. 

As part of debugging info capture, I decided to write intermediate results to a text file, for a review of what would be input to the analysis. 

The code spent only about 2.3 seconds to save this info to the capture text file.My original software would then proceed with analysis.

But this delay to get on with testing the analysis results (> 12 sec = 10 + 2.3) quickly became tedious.

I found the analysis effort otherwise challenging, and recognized I might save time by capturing intermediate data, and thus avoiding most (but not all) of the data measurement and capture effort.So the debug capture to intermediate file became a convenient split to the overall effort.

Part 2 of the split app reads the <30 million byte intermediate file in somewhat less 0.5 seconds, very much reducing the analysis development cycle (edit-compile-link-run-evaluate), which was was (usually) no longer burdened with the 12+ second measure and data gen.

While 28 M Bytes is not BIG data, I valued the time savings for my analysis code development effort.



FYI - My intermediate file contained a single letter for each 'thread entry into the critical section event'.With 10 threads, the letters were 'A', 'B', ... 'J'.(reminds me of dna encoding) 

For each thread, my analysis supported splitting counts per thread.Where vxWorks would 'balance' the threads blocked at a semaphore, Linux does NOT ... which was new to me.

Each thread ran a different number of times through the single critical section, but each thread got about 10% of the opportunities.

Technique: simple encoded text file with captured information ready to be analyzed.

Note:I was expecting to test piping the output of app part 1 into app part 2.Still could, I guess.WIP.

I am trying to create a python 3 IDE and text editor in python to learn more about tkinter. In it (because it is an IDE) I am attempting to run code entered by the user. The best way that I could find was to use exec(). This works, as show in the IDLE below:

>>> exec(input('PROMPT: '))
PROMPT: print('Hello World') #Entered in by user, this could be anything.
Hello World # <-- Output


Yet, the exec() function knows about its surroundings.

>>> important_variable = 'important value' #Say that this is important.
>>> exec(input('PROMPT: '))
PROMPT: important_variable = 'meaningless value' #In the IDE, user unknowingly re-assigns to a meaningless value
>>> important_variable #look at the value
'meaningless value' #Yes, the value was changed.


This is not what I want. I want no connection to the main program, other then values I put in. (for example, changing the sys.stdin, sys.stdout, and sys.stderr values to a tkinter GUI)

My idea was to use the extended use of the exec() function (brought to you be help()):

exec(source, globals=None, locals=None, /)
Execute the given source in the context of globals and locals.

The source may be a string representing one or more Python statements
or a code object as returned by compile().
The globals must be a dictionary and locals can be any mapping,
defaulting to the current globals and locals.
If only globals is given, locals defaults to it.


I tried to use a empty dict for globals, and I left locals blank. This seems to work at a first look.

>>> important_variable = 'important value'
>>> exec_globals = {} #create a black dict of globals
>>> exec(input('PROMPT: '), exec_globals) #pass in the blank dict
PROMPT: important_variable = 'meaningless value' #change to value?
>>> important_variable #look at the value
'important value' #value is kept!


However, the program the code was run by is seen in exceptions:

>>> exec_globals = {} #create a black dict of globals
>>> exec(input('PROMPT: '), exec_globals) #pass in the blank dict
PROMPT: THIS SHALL CAUSE A ERROR!
Traceback (most recent call last):
File ""<pyshell#288>"", line 1, in <module>
exec(input('PROMPT: '), exec_globals) # <-- YOU CAN SEE THE CODE
File ""<string>"", line 1
THIS SHALL CAUSE A ERROR!
 ^
SyntaxError: invalid syntax


How do I prevent this from happening and remove any connection to the program as seen from the code that is entered by the user. I would still like some control in the program however, like changing the values of sys.stdin, sys.stdout, and sys.stderr. Is exec(source, blank_dict) the way to go, or is there a better way to do it?
",https://stackoverflow.com/questions/52807698/run-exec-without-connection-to-the-main-program-in-python-3,"
After a lot of digging around, I found the answer to my question.

The answer is in the code module. As the python documentation on the code module states:


The code module provides facilities to implement read-eval-print loops in Python.


Basically tools to simulate code running. The function that the code module gives doesn't only just help with a read-eval-print loop, but it can also run code without a connection to the main program. Take this program called runcode.py for a example:

import code

important_variable = 'important value'

program = '\n'.join([
'for n in range(10):',
'print(n)',
'important_variable = None',
'def error(): raise Exception()',
'error()',
])

interpreter = code.InteractiveInterpreter()
interpreter.runsource(program, '<FAKE MEANINGLESS FILE NAME>', 'exec')

print()
print(important_variable)


Which outputs the following:

0
1
2
3
4
5
6
7
8
9
Traceback (most recent call last):
File ""<FAKE MEANINGLESS FILE NAME>"", line 5, in <module> #No connection!
File ""<FAKE MEANINGLESS FILE NAME>"", line 4, in error #No connection!
Exception

important value


If you are reading from a real file, replace '<FAKE MEANINGLESS FILE NAME>' with the absolute path to the file. This will give you a more advanced traceback (error message will include what was on the line)

The great thing is that this works with a setup and end scripts, like so:

import code

program = '\n'.join([
'for n in range(10):',
'print(n)',
'def error(): raise Exception()',
'error()',
])

interpreter = code.InteractiveInterpreter()

#Setup code. This could change sys.stdin, stdout, etc. and setup variables!
interpreter.runsource('setup_stuff = None', 'whatever name you want', 'exec')

#Run code
interpreter.runsource(program, '<FAKE MEANINGLESS FILE NAME>', 'exec')

#Process Code now that the program is done, this might get the values in local() or something like that.
interpreter.runsource(program, 'whatever name you want', 'exec')


And that's it!

I am using visual code IDE for coding and a plugin ""live server"" which is very handy for quick checks of the changes made in code and everything with bootstrap worked excellently.

Answering this old question for everybody having the same problem.

The log output needs to include this part:

File ""/path/to/file.py"", line 140


Using Python's logging module you can achieve this with

format=""File \""%(pathname)s\"", line %(lineno)d""


Here is a complete example of the logging config

logging.basicConfig(level=10, format=""[%(asctime)s] %(levelname)s [File \""%(pathname)s\"", line %(lineno)d] %(message)s"", datefmt=""%H:%M:%S"", stream=sys.stdout)

I do not know why but when I change the color scheme of the spyder editor (I have the latest version installed and I do it through preferences -> syntax coloring), the variable explorer's color remains the same:



Since this is very distracting for me I searched it and found something more like a package called QDarkStylesheet that you can install and import, but it sounds a little tricky as I figured some people have reported several issues with it in GitHub! So, is there a straightforward way for making the variable explorer have the same dark color in spyder?
",https://stackoverflow.com/questions/50192786/spyder-ide-make-variable-explorer-to-follow-the-color-scheme-of-the-editor,"
(Spyder maintainer here) Right now (May/2018) is not possible to make the coloring shown in the Variable Explorer follow the one in the Editor and IPython console.

However, we're working to make this possible for Spyder 4 (to be released in 2019).

I'm using eclipse (zend studio 11), and it was working fine for quite sometime, but for two days when i type class= as soon as i hit the equals sign it takes about 10 minutes hanging, with no response, after that things just go back to normal.
Any ideas?
",https://stackoverflow.com/questions/50627810/eclipse-ide-hangs-when-typing-class,"
Zend Studio 11 it's old and unsupported. To find whats going on see this wiki page https://wiki.eclipse.org/How_to_report_a_deadlock. In most cases problem appear with broken DLTK index, so:


Close Zend Studio
Drop WORKSPACE_LOC/.metadata/.plugins/org.eclipse.dltk.core.index.sql.h2 and/or WORKSPACE_LOC/.metadata/.plugins/org.eclipse.dltk.core.index.lucene 
Open Zend Studio and wait for indexing


Anyway I strongly suggest switching to upcoming Eclipse Photon. Since this release code completion is asynchronous.

You may have some character enconding issues. Are you copying and paste the code? If so, don't!

Just type in the code yourself in any editor, notepad or just nano. It should work then!
............................................................
As woland noted, it's an encoding issue, which is that

Regarding IDEs, there are some plugins that provide syntax highlighting, syntax checking, etc. for editors like Atom, Sublime Text, and Kate. You can find instructions clicking on the ""Editors & Plug-ins"" tab under the Downloads page on the Jolie website.

I work on React-Native in WebStorm.
Problem 1
I have some class, I want use auto import function of WebStorm, It works for some classes, but not for all.
When I type name and hit Ctrl + Space, it does not auto import class.

I tried Alt + Enter also, it has no import suggestion in list.

Problem 2
Then I manually imported the class, now WebStorm is not able to show methods suggestion with auto complete, when I press Ctrl + Space, my methods are not listed there.

Utility.js
export function alertMessage(alertMessage) {
Alert.alert(
""Alert"",
alertMessage,
[{ text: ""OK"", onPress: () => console.log(""OK Pressed"") }],
{ cancelable: false }
);
}

Is there some setting of WebStorm I am missing. I want to improve my productivity.
",https://stackoverflow.com/questions/52735121/webstorm-auto-complete-auto-import-are-not-working,"
The simplest way to achieve correct code completion while developing any (not only react) app is to add support for required type scrip libraries via IDE itself. Assuming you using Web Storm IDE for development:


Go to Settings (Ctrl + Alt + S) -> Languages & Frameworks
Expand JavaScript->Library
When using react, I suggest to add: react; react-dom; react-native (for mobile app development)
Click Apply when you done 

............................................................
You are exporting your function using named export syntax (export function alertMessage()), but importing it as default, aliasing it to Utility; the IDE can't know what Utility is, thus no completion/autoimport is provided. Either change your export to default, or import your function using named import syntax
............................................................
Just Install @types/react-native for suggestions, type hints and Auto imports.
Npm

npm install @types/react-native

Yarn

yarn add @types/react-native

Works like charm for me in Webstorm :) before its was not.

The good thing with anaconda is that it should make your life easier without getting your hands too dirty. If you use only basic libs, only install packages with anaconda commands to be sure not to corrupt your python environment.

if you're on linux, use conda install -c conda-forge opencv

on windows, do the same with the ""anaconda prompt"" terminal.

If you still have some trouble with you numpy version, try conda update numpy

Create a virtual env. Following which run following instals
pip install numpy scipy matplotlib scikit-learn jupyter
pip install opencv-contrib-python
pip install dlib

You may verify the install via this script in Python environment- 
import cv2
cv2.version
............................................................

Remove all previous/current (if any) python installation
Install Anaconda and add anaconda to PATH(Envirnoment variables:: Adavanced system setting->Environment variables->under system variables go to variable PATHand click edit to add new envirnomental variables)

Open anaconda prompt with admin access. Type and enter:-
conda update --all
conda install -c conda-forge opencv
conda install spyder=4.0.0(spyder updation)
conda update python (for python updation)

conda install -c conda-forge opencv 

conda install -c conda-forge/label/gcc7 opencv

conda install -c conda-forge/label/broken opencv

I've noticed that under Visual Studio common C commands are a bit different,
the only example I can think of right now is that VS insists on using scanf_s instead of scanf, but I'm sure there are other quirks.

what I'm asking is, should I be learning, or even working with C on VS and why?

Thanks
",https://stackoverflow.com/questions/50121493/visual-studio-c-programming,"
MSVC does not insist but only issues warnings, to provoke you into using their own non-standard functions. The warning message from MSVC tells you what to do:


warning C4996: 'scanf': This function or variable may be unsafe. Consider using scanf_s instead. To disable deprecation, use 
_CRT_SECURE_NO_WARNINGS


which means putting #define _CRT_SECURE_NO_WARNINGS before any #include files.

I put the following lines before any #include

#define _CRT_SECURE_NO_WARNINGS
#define _CRT_SECURE_NO_DEPRECATE
#define _CRT_NONSTDC_NO_DEPRECATE
#define _USE_MATH_DEFINES

#include <stdio.h>// etcetera


Anyway MSVC does not comply with C standards.

I have installed Apache Netbeans 9.0 recently in Mac running macOS Mojave. I am trying to change the Netbeans theme to ""Dark Look And Feel Themes"" but I can't find the options.
Previously, I have used the older versions (8.2, 8.1, 8.0.2) of Netbeans. To change the theme, I navigate to
Tools -> Plugins -> Available Plugins 

Install the ""Dark Look And Feel Themes"" plugin and restart the IDE to reflect the change.
But, I don't find this plugin in the Apache Netbeans 9.0

I also checked whether these plugins are available to download from online. So that I can add them using 'Downloaded' option. But, they are only available for older versions.
http://plugins.netbeans.org/plugin/62424/darcula-laf-for-netbeans
http://plugins.netbeans.org/plugin/52624/netbeans-dark-theme
So, I am a bit stuck here. Any help will be much appreciated. There are few similar stack overflow questions raised earlier, but they all talk about the old version of Netbeans.
",https://stackoverflow.com/questions/52688439/changing-theme-in-apache-netbeans-9-0,"
Updated 4/11/19:

Based on a comment from @superbiji below, Darcula + Norway Today works fine with NetBeans 11.0.



Updated 2/7/19:

Note that the answer below applies only to NetBeans 9.0. The situation is a little different on NetBeans 10.0 where the Dark Look and Feel plugin (themes ""Dark Metal"" and ""Dark Nimbus"") also worked fine. See Projects, Files, Services, Navigator color background.



I tried to download then manually install those two plugins on NetBeans 9.0, but it didn't work for me:


Download the plugins as zip files, and unzip them.
Tools > Plugins > click the Downloaded tab > click Add Plugins...
The Add Plugins dialog opens, but it requires you to select a jar or nbm file, and no files of those types exist in the downloaded zip files.


However, there is an alternative approach that works for Darcula (but not for Dark Look And Feel Themes). It is a simple two step process:


Make the Darcula plugin available. 
Automatically install the plugin, just as you would on NetBeans 8.2.


To make the plugin available:


Tools > Plugins > Settings tab > Click the Add button.
In the Update Center Customizer dialog that opens:


Enter some descriptive value in the Name field such as NetBeans 8.2 plugins
Enter http://plugins.netbeans.org/nbpluginportal/updates/8.2/catalog.xml.gz in the URL field.
Click OK to make the plugins associated with that URL available for installation.



Now click the Available Plugins tab. You should see a lot of new entries, including one for Darcula LAF for NetBeans:


Check that entry and click Install, just as you would on NetBeans 8.2. 


NetBeans 9.0 should restart using the Darcula theme:



Notes:


I don't think this approach is formally supported by NetBeans or the plugin author, but it works fine.
To customize Darcula settings: Tools > Options > Appearance > click the Darcula Look and Feel tab. 
To switch from Darcula to one of the built in NetBeans look and feel options: Tools > Options > Appearance > click the Look and Feel tab > select an entry from the Preferred look and feel drop list.

I can recommend you to check NetBeans Themes website. It allows you to design and download your own themes.

I'm trying to extend Monaco Editor to allow users to write in a hybrid of JavaScript and another language, using delimiters to separate them within the same file, similarly to how Markdown allows writing multiple languages using fenced code blocks.

The difference is that I want to keep all the other IDE features that Monaco has built in for JavaScript, such as linting (done via diagnostics), smart auto-completion, jump-to-definition, auto-formatting helpers, and every other IDE feature that comes with Monaco's built-in JavaScript mode. I'd like these features to still work within the JavaScript portion of the code that Monaco is editing, and be disabled for the sub-language portion.

My first attempt was to call setMonarchTokensProvider, passing in a modified version of TypeScript's tokenizer rules. Specifically, I was able to add the beginning-fence delimiter to the root rule and create a new rule for the sub-language in the same way the documentation for Monarch (Monaco's syntax highligher) describes, using @nextEmbedded. (For testing purposes, I've been hard-coding CSS as the embedded language.)

When I call setMonarchTokensProvider like this for the language ""javascript"", it completely ignores this syntax highlighting tokenizer, and colors the code-fences of CSS as invalid JavaScript, indicating that you cannot override the built-in JavaScript mode this way.

When I call setMonarchTokensProvider with a new language (e.g. ""mylang"") and set the editor to use that language, it provides correct syntax highlighting (!) for this CSS-in-JS hybrid language. But all other advanced features that were found in the JavaScript mode are no longer present. The editor didn't have any smart auto-completion for methods defined on classes in the same file, or any in-editor error-reporting for invalid syntax, or any of its trademark JavaScript IDE features.

So my next attempt was to modify the pre-bundled Monaco code's TypeScript definition to include my custom syntax highlighting rules. This correctly highlighted my CSS-in-JS code completely (!), when setting the language to ""typescript"", and left all the other features intact (!) including diagnostics reporting (live-validation and underlining of errors), auto-completion, all of it! (I didn't try it with ""javascript"" but it's safe to assume it probably works or is trivial to get it working, since JavaScript is actually implemented as a variant configuration of the TypeScript mode in Monaco.)

Unfortunately, it also considered the entire CSS portion of it, including the fence around it, to be invalid JavaScript code.



I know that this is theoretically doable, because within HTML mode, you can embed CSS or JS with full support for proper validation and auto-completion and every other IDE feature; basically, every sub-language in an HTML file works like it's in its own file: HTML features in the root of the file, CSS features within style tags, JS features within script tags.

But digging into the TypeScript plugin's implementation inside Monaco, it's not clear where to begin editing this, either as a user of Monaco the library, or by forking it and patching it up where necessary. I started at trying to modify the DiagnostcsAdapter [sic] and tracing where it's actually implemented, but I got stuck two function-calls deep, where it seems to push a promise of syntax validation that returns a value that's used later, but the implementation of getSyntacticDiagnostics just shells the work out to some other implementation that I can't find anywhere else in the repo, nor in the monaco-languages repo or the vscode repo.

I make the similar thing. My solution is to place non-JS code inside a block comment:

regularJsCode()
/* 
[your-syntax-identifying-start-token]
place any syntax you want here
[your-syntax-identifying-end-token]
*/
regularJsCode()


Then you can process it with your tools, parsers, IDE extension etc. And the coolest part you can make VSCode to syntax-highlight it like you want so it won't seem like some hack.

This approach is preferrable because your JS file still remains a 100% valid JS file.

If you still don't want to put your syntax into comments, then you should create your own file extension like .jsx/.tsx. In practical, VSCode terms this means you need to create VSCode extension with language server and stuff. This is not so easy, but the documentation is good. You could assemble your own JS highlighting code inside your VSCode extension using language server: https://github.com/sourcegraph/javascript-typescript-langserver
............................................................
According to the creator of Monaco:


Architecturally, you can do the following:


use monaco-editor-core directly
define a new language to the editor
fork monaco-typescript and change it to work with your newly defined langauge id. Then, modify the TS language host code to not pass the original models to TypeScript, but first run a preprocess which strips your custom language out of the text, and then only passes on valid TypeScript to the TS compiler. One idea is to replace each character that you remove with a space. This will leave all the position/offset computation work without any effort on your side.


Good luck!

I was messing around with colors and I changed this:

When the cursor is on a certain method, all similar methods are highlighted:

http://prntscr.com/jc0kzi

It changed to black color, I want it to go back to the default of white.

Where is this option in here:

Mostly likely the Occurrences values on the Annotations preference page.

Try

Preferences->General->Editors->Text Editors->Annotations->Occurrences

And change the color according to your requirement.

I have been programming visual basic for 20+ years. This problem appeared suddenly in Access 2010.

When I try to open immediate window, Locals window and Watch Windows I get the error message: File Not Found

I did have problems stating Access 2010. It would reinstall Office and then give me this error: ""error 1907 could not register font"". Normally i could just hit ignore 3 times, and then the program would start. I wanted to fix this problem, so after clicking ignore two times, I chose Cancel the last time. The installation progress bar went backward. I did a ""SFC /SCANNOW"" with no problems identified. I rebooted. Next time I got into Access VBA IDE I could not access either immediate, locals or watch windows. When trying, I get ""File not found.""

Since then, I have made a repair of Office 2010. I did update windows and restart several times. Nothing is working.

In Excel 2010 VBA IDE, the windows are not missing.

I use Windows 10. Office 2016 is also installed on this computer.

Repairing Office 2010 was not enough. 
I had to remove Office 2010 completely and reinstalled it.

I need to increase the height of Visual studio Cursor |. I feel that will give better flow to writing code. Sublime text have the option, but I can't find that for Visual studio code. Can any one help to do that please?


",https://stackoverflow.com/questions/51074554/how-to-increase-visual-studio-code-cursor-height,"
You can try and apply the pending PR 28109 ""support custom cursor height"".

It does resolve Microsoft/vscode issue 27931: ""Configure cursor height""


Using the caret_extra_* properties in Sublime and with css in Atom, it is possible to configure the height of the cursor.
I would love to be able to make the cursor a little bit taller.
Is this possible with VSCode?
