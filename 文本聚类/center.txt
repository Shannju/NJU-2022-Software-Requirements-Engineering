I'm trying to get "go to definition" working for a JUCE project created with Projucer. I've tried both CLion and Visual Studio Code, but they can't seem to find definitions that live in the JUCE libraries.I'm on Ubuntu. Is there a blessed path for this? I'm normally a vim user, but I'm willing to try any IDE. I've just figured this out!In VS Code go View and Command Palette and type C/C++: Edit Configurations (UI) which will take to the IntelliSense Configurations page. Under Include path, on a new line, specify the path to JUCE e.g. ~/JUCE/**.Note: The two stars are needed to tell VS Code to look through subdirectories.This will create a hidden folder .vscode in your project folder with this configuration.You will need to repeat these steps for each project you make.Definitions and code completion should now work.To compile your code, in your project folder go Builds then LinuxMakefile and in a terminal run the command make. Finally, go to the builds folder and run your project ./exampleProject.............................................................You need to add the JUCE/modules folder to your search path, not the top-level JUCE/ folder!If you're using the Projucer, you'll also need to add the JuceLibrarySource/ folder to your search path.............................................................What I ended up doing was using FRUT to convert my project from a Projucer project to a CMake project. CLion was able to understand the CMake project, and thus, the "go to definition" and autocomplete features started working.

I installed PyCharm on Ubuntu 18.04 by extracting the tarball into /etc/ and creating a shortcut through the Tools menu.I installed IdeaVim through the marketplace, and the Vim plug-in is working as expected.Now I want to import my vim settings from my .vimrc. I just copied the .vimrc to ~/.ideavimrc and reloaded my IDE. However, my remappings are not working. I tried sourcing the rc file using :source ~/.ideavimrc, but this doesn't work either.The only content of my .ideavimrc file is this line:xnoremap p pgvyI really hate the paste-setting of vim, so I need this remapping and I'm lost. Thanks for the help. This was an actual bug with Idea VIM plugin and the .ideavimrc file, found here.It has been resolved since.

When using PyCharm tab only indents the line if I select it first. This is not the same with VSCode which adds an indent of, I think, 4 spaces each time I press the tab key. I believe this is a bug but I have tried everything I have found and nothing seems to work.Things I have tried:Remapping the tab key to indent line (this only works if the line is selected)Using Smart TabUsing Use Tab CharacterNone of these have fixed the issue It is not a bug, as the default behaviour is common on editors (also way before VS). It is not uncommon to make tables (e.g. on C header files, defining constants). VS took a different way. Note: in PyCharm (at least with KDE key bindings), if you select one or more lines, then Tab (and Shift-Tab) will indent/unindent the code.But you can reproduce your desired behaviour: Go on settings/preferences, then Keymap menu. I recommend you to save current settings, and start a new custom setting (e.g. adding "Tab" to the name).Then on the right of the right/bottom search field, look for actions with a key: press it, then press Tab. You see that there is an action "Tab", which links to Tab. Right click, and remove the key. We need this, not to conflict with the new behaviour of Tab (only this matter, we keep the other Tab).Now we should give Tab the desired behaviour: On Keymap -> Editor Actions -> Indent Line or Selection (note: you can just look "Indent Line"). Here you select your new key to be Tab (you should press the + for such special keys).Now the settings seems similar to VS. I'm not using it much, so e.v. you should tweak other settings. Note, on my KDE keybindings, Shift+Tab is already set as Unindent.............................................................Go to settings ---> editor ----> code style ----> check the box for "detect and use existing file indents for editing".Under Code style again, select Python. At the right hand side, you will see Tab size, ensure it's 4, the indent should also be 4............................................................in the setting | keymap, select Windows (not Windows copy) or click reset.enter image description here

When running tests from command line, capturing SIGINT works fine. However, is there a way to pass SIGINT signal to code when running tests from GoLand IDE?When running from command line:go test -v -run TestSth and then calling Ctrl + C it captures fine.Example code:package mainimport ("fmt""os""os/signal""syscall""testing""time")func TestMain(m *testing.M) {terminate := make(chan os.Signal)signal.Notify(terminate, syscall.SIGINT)go func() {<-terminatefmt.Println()fmt.Println("CAPTURED!!!") // want to get here when running tests from IDE}()exitCode := m.Run()os.Exit(exitCode)}func TestSth(t *testing.T) {time.Sleep(time.Second * 5)} Get the current process information by calling FindProcess on the current PID and signal the interrupt to it using Process.Signalfunc TestSth(t *testing.T) { go func() { // Sleep added for demonstrative purposes, can be removed time.Sleep(time.Second * 1) p, err := os.FindProcess(os.Getpid()) if err != nil { panic(err) } p.Signal(syscall.SIGINT) }() time.Sleep(time.Second * 5)}

IntelliJ IDEA. It is info menu (when you stop cursor on class name). How to enable view full location of class (file)? Example: Oleg_Library.main.java.src.mypackage.Test It's not possible afaik. But you can create a feature request for it in https://youtrack.jetbrains.com/issues/IDEA

Forgive me if this is a really stupid question, but I haven't found any answers yet - or maybe I don't know the correct thing to ask for.Given the following files that are part of the same project:MyProject.htmlMyProject.cssMyProject.js(and a MyProject.py that runs on the server to make things happen). . . where all three of these items are related and are actually part of a single project and they need to integrate together.The "html" part of VS code makes sure the html is correct.The "css" part of VS code makes sure the css is correct.the JavaScript part of VS code makes sure the javascript is correct.However, they may not be correct together as a unified whole - I may have changed something in the javascript that references something in the html that may not yet exist - because I forgot to write it, and I don't discover this until I launch things and watch the web-page go all pear-shaped in ways I've never heard of before.Is there something that will take all these pieces and say "Hey!You changed the definition of this element here in the Javascript but not in the HTML (or the CSS or whatever)In other words, not only do I want to know if the individual files are syntactically correct, but do they agree with each other?If there is a "something" that does this, what is it called? That tool will never exist and for good reasons, it'd slow the living hell out of your computer when programming and wouldn't fair well as a best practice. Though it's cool, it's cooler to write code effectively and not have a slow code editor. So to that suggestion is write your JavaScript and HTML together hand in hand; split view and you won't ever have an issue. CSS can come into play any time.Your best option for knowing if code is correct, would be a linter but that won't help you with the issues you face if you're calling elements that don't exist or did you'll want to improve how you code these functions/events.As requested submitted as an answer for the OP.

I want to learn bash. Is there any possiblity I can set up a similar IDE (as PowerShell ISE and AutoIt SciTe, with editor and console) for editing and running bash scripts in Windows? Some IDEs support bash language and you can use them. I recommend to you to use visual studio code (VSCode). It has many plugins like Bash Debug and you can use them. You can download it from official site (link)

Google has failed me. I'd like a way to have TypeScript syntax validation in my Ace editor. I've found an Ace-based TypeScript Playground by basarat AKA 'That TypeScript Guy' but the repo has no good README and I doubt the validator is up to date with TypeScript's newer features, as the last commit is from years ago.I understand how to add the custom listing itself in Ace; it's just the actual TypeScript linter I am struggling to find. It seems there is no up-to-date maintained one; I'm surprised there isn't one. Currently, I debounce a call to get diagnostics via a library called ts-morph, which provides developer-friendly methods for the TypeScript compiler API. I get those diagnostics, loop over them, and add my own custom annotations to the editor:const diagnostics = getDiagnostics(code)aceEditor.getSession().setAnnotations(diagnostics.map(diagnostic => {return {row: diagnostic.getLineNumber() - 1,column: diagnostic.getStart(),text: diagnostic.getMessageText().toString(),type: convertTypeScriptCategoryToAceType(diagnostic.getCategory()),}}))This is okay for now, but I'd like to do it the 'Ace' way with a Web Worker in the format they suggest.I am slightly open to migrating away from Ace Editor; for example I also know about TypeScript Playground, but this doesn't seem to have an open-source repository. Other famous online IDEs, like CodeSandbox also must have their ways of doing it. (I looked a little bit into CodeSandbox's source but their repository is expectedly quite complex.)Can anybody provide me insight into getting nice TypeScript IntelliSense and syntax checking in a web-based IDE? Is it possible via current open source tools? Of course, within a few minutes of posting this, I find the answer (and it was posted in the comments). Microsoft indeed does have their own editor called monaco-editor. This is actually the very same that powers VSCode.

When I try to see the side menu upon clicking "show annotate" this message appears only on this file. Other than that annotations work for all other files.number of lines annotated by git is not equal to number of lines inthe file. Check file encoding and line separatorsThis problem occurs in Intellij. And in my case in Android Studio I know it isn't the solution but I wasn't able find out the root of the problembut I share what I did to get it working.This happened to me after I hibernated my win 11 (WSL2 and docker) and the next day I tried to work.After I restarted phpStorm it said, git was not even installed.I didgit reset hard and clean,reopened the project inside phpStorm, (after this it was still broken)restarted the computerafter all of this it started to work again.............................................................WSL2, Windows 11, Goland GoLand 2022.1.2. Same problem.IDE restart didn't help, what helped is to restart the WSL2 env:wsl --shutdown ubuntuBefore restart you should close the IDE.............................................................Was seeing this issue in both intelliJ and PyCharm at the same timefor the same file. I did not check if the issue persisted with anyother file (perhaps should have).Though that putting the IDE in power save mode may have done it butremoving from power save mode did not work. Restarting the IDE by invalidating cache did not help either.Then I realized that I had put that particular file to be assumed asunchanged by running git update-index --assume-unchanged <filename>Once I undid that by running git update-index --no-assume-unchanged <filename>, the warning went away - and the IDE showed all of thelines properly annotated again.HTH............................................................faced this issue in GoLand (sibling of IntelliJ) and, when opened the same project in VSCode, its working fine.This gave a hint, that something is wrong in .idea folder, removed the .idea folder and opened the project again in GoLand, It Worked & annotation works wellThanks

I'd like to be able to visually see the relationships of the files I require from every file in my project - that's because I'm using redux in my project, but there are probably cases where I introduced anti-pattern behaviour, by running code without dispatching an action creator first, and I'd love to visually check how complicated things are at this point.Example: If A depends on B, and B depends on C, I'd love to visually see A with an arrow connected to B, with an arrow connected to C.Is there any util, or IDE functionality to help me visualise my js code like that?Thank you I've used madge before: npm link with install instructions. If you also install graphviz, you can export an svg of your dependencies with madge --image graph.svg path/to/app.js.See example of one of my more modular repos! 

I work on React-Native in WebStorm.Problem 1I have some class, I want use auto import function of WebStorm, It works for some classes, but not for all.When I type name and hit Ctrl + Space, it does not auto import class.I tried Alt + Enter also, it has no import suggestion in list.Problem 2Then I manually imported the class, now WebStorm is not able to show methods suggestion with auto complete, when I press Ctrl + Space, my methods are not listed there.Utility.jsexport function alertMessage(alertMessage) {Alert.alert("Alert",alertMessage,[{ text: "OK", onPress: () => console.log("OK Pressed") }],{ cancelable: false });}Is there some setting of WebStorm I am missing. I want to improve my productivity. The simplest way to achieve correct code completion while developing any (not only react) app is to add support for required type scrip libraries via IDE itself. Assuming you using Web Storm IDE for development:Go to Settings (Ctrl + Alt + S) -> Languages & FrameworksExpand JavaScript->LibraryWhen using react, I suggest to add: react; react-dom; react-native (for mobile app development)Click Apply when you done ............................................................You are exporting your function using named export syntax (export function alertMessage()), but importing it as default, aliasing it to Utility; the IDE can't know what Utility is, thus no completion/autoimport is provided. Either change your export to default, or import your function using named import syntax............................................................Just Install @types/react-native for suggestions, type hints and Auto imports.Npmnpm install @types/react-nativeYarnyarn add @types/react-nativeWorks like charm for me in Webstorm :) before its was not.

Is there a way to debug a piece of code in PyCharm in parts. For example in the following code, foo1()foo2()foo3()foo1() takes a long time to execute. Since I need to debug foo2(), I want to start my debugger from foo2() but with the results of foo1() being available. How can I achieve this? Is there a standard name for this debugging technique? I recall MATLAB having a feature of dividing your scripts into cells which can then be executed and debugged independently. I guess I'm looking for a similar sort of feature in PyCharm if it exists. PyCharm has its own Python Interactive Mode, Python Console, that allows you to run & debug python code in cells (as is done in iPython notebooks, with added debugging functionalities)Press Ctrl + Shift + a, type Python Console, then press Enter.

What is the meaning of the following control characters: Carriage returnLine feedForm feed Carriage return means to return to the beginning of the current line without advancing downward.The name comes from a printer's carriage, as monitors were rare when the name was coined.This is commonly escaped as "\r", abbreviated CR, and has ASCII value 13 or 0xD.Linefeed means to advance downward to the next line; however, it has been repurposed and renamed.Used as "newline", it terminates lines (commonly confused with separating lines).This is commonly escaped as "\n", abbreviated LF or NL, and has ASCII value 10 or 0xA. CRLF (but not CRNL) is used for the pair "\r\n".Form feed means advance downward to the next "page".It was commonly used as page separators, but now is also used as section separators.Text editors can use this character when you "insert a page break".This is commonly escaped as "\f", abbreviated FF, and has ASCII value 12 or 0xC.As control characters, they may be interpreted in various ways.The most important interpretation is how these characters delimit lines.Lines end with NL on Unix (including OS X), CRLF on Windows, and CR on older Macs.Note the shift in meaning from LF to NL, for the exact same character, gives the differences between Windows and Unix, which is also why many Windows programs use CRLF to separate instead of terminate lines.Many text editors can read files in any of these three formats and convert between them, but not all utilities can.Form feed is much less commonly used.As page separator, it can only come between lines or at the start or end of the file.............................................................\r is carriage return and moves the cursor back like if i will do-printf("stackoverflow\rnine")ninekoverflowmeans it has shifted the cursor to the beginning of "stackoverflow" and overwrites the starting four characters since "nine" is four character long.\n is new line character which changes the line and takes the cursor to the beginning of a new line like-printf("stackoverflow\nnine")stackoverflownine\f is form feed, its use has become obsolete but it is used for giving indentation likeprintf("stackoverflow\fnine")stackoverflow nineif i will write like-printf("stackoverflow\fnine\fgreat")stackoverflow nine great............................................................In short:Carriage return (\r or 0xD): To take control at starting on the same line.          Line feed (\n or 0xA): To Take control at starting on the next line.         Form feed (\f or 0xC): To take control at starting on the next page.More details and more control characters can be found on the following page: Control character............................................................Have a look at Wikipedia:Systems based on ASCII or a compatible character set use either LF (Line feed, '\n', 0x0A, 10 in decimal) or CR (Carriage return, '\r', 0x0D, 13 in decimal) individually, or CR followed by LF (CR+LF, 0x0D 0x0A). These characters are based on printer commands: The line feed indicated that one line of paper should feed out of the printer, and a carriage return indicated that the printer carriage should return to the beginning of the current line.............................................................\f is used for page break.You cannot see any effect in the console. But when you use this character constant in your file then you can see the difference.Other example is that if you can redirect your output to a file then you don't have to write a file or use file handling.For ex:Write this code in c++void main(){clrscr();cout<<"helloooooo" ;cout<<"\f";cout<<"hiiiii" ;}and when you compile this it generatean exe(for ex. abc.exe)then you can redirect your output to a file using this:abc > xyz.docthen open the file xyz.doc you can see the actual page break between hellooo and hiiii................................................................On old paper-printer terminals, advancing to the next line involved two actions: moving the print head back to the beginning of the horizontal scan range (carriage return) and advancing the roll of paper being printed on (line feed).Since we no longer use paper-printer terminals, those actions aren't really relevant anymore, but the characters used to signal them have stuck around in various incarnations.............................................................Apart from above information, there is still an interesting history of LF (\n) and CR (\r).[Original author : 阮一峰 Source : http://www.ruanyifeng.com/blog/2006/04/post_213.html]Before computer came out, there was a type of teleprinter called Teletype Model 33. It can print 10 characters each second. But there is one problem with this, after finishing printing each line, it will take 0.2 second to move to next line, which is time of printing 2 characters. If a new characters is transferred during this 0.2 second, then this new character will be lost.So scientists found a way to solve this problem, they add two ending characters after each line, one is 'Carriage return', which is to tell the printer to bring the print head to the left.; the other one is 'Line feed', it tells the printer to move the paper up 1 line.Later, computer became popular, these two concepts are used on computers. At that time, the storage device was very expensive, so some scientists said that it was expensive to add two characters at the end of each line, one is enough, so there are some arguments about which one to use.In UNIX/Mac and Linux, '\n' is put at the end of each line, in Windows, '\r\n' is put at the end of each line. The consequence of this use is that files in UNIX/Mac will be displayed in one line if opened in Windows. While file in Windows will have one^M at the end of each line if opened in UNIX or Mac.............................................................Consider an IBM 1403 impact printer. CR moved the print head to the start of the line, but did NOT advance the paper. This allowed for "overprinting", placing multiple lines of output on one line. Things like underlining were achieved this way, as was BOLD print. LF advanced the paper one line. If there was no CR, the next line would print as a staggered-step because LF didn't move the print head. FF advanced the paper to the next page. It typically also moved the print head to the start of the first line on the new page, but you might need CR for that. To be sure, most programmers coded CRFF instead of CRLF at the end of the last line on a page because an extra CR created by FF wouldn't matter.............................................................As a supplement,1, Carriage return:It's a printer terminology meaning changing the print location to the beginning of current line. In computer world, it means return to the beginning of current line in most cases but stands for new line rarely.2, Line feed:It's a printer terminology meaning advancing the paper one line. So Carriage return and Line feed are used together to start to print at the beginning of a new line. In computer world, it generally has the same meaning as newline.3, Form feed: It's a printer terminology, I like the explanation in this thread. If you were programming for a 1980s-style printer, it would eject thepaper and start a new page. You are virtually certain to never needit.http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Form_feedIt's almost obsolete and you can refer to Escape sequence \f - form feed - what exactly is it? for detailed explanation.Note, we can use CR or LF or CRLF to stand for newline in some platforms but newline can't be stood by them in some other platforms. Refer to wiki Newline for details.LF:Multics, Unix and Unix-like systems (Linux, OS X, FreeBSD, AIX,Xenix, etc.), BeOS, Amiga, RISC OS, and othersCR:Commodore 8-bit machines, Acorn BBC, ZX Spectrum, TRS-80, AppleII family, Oberon, the classic Mac OS up to version 9, MIT LispMachine and OS-9RS:QNX pre-POSIX implementation0x9B:Atari 8-bit machines using ATASCII variant of ASCII (155 indecimal)CR+LF: Microsoft Windows, DOS (MS-DOS, PC DOS, etc.), DEC TOPS-10,RT-11, CP/M, MP/M, Atari TOS, OS/2, Symbian OS, Palm OS, Amstrad CPC,and most other early non-Unix and non-IBM OSesLF+CR: Acorn BBC and RISC OS spooled text output............................................................."\n" is the linefeed character.It means end the present line and go to a new line for anyone who is reading it.............................................................Carriage return and line feed are also references to typewriters, in that the with a small push on the handle on the left side of the carriage (the place where the paper goes), the paper would rotate a small amount around the cylinder, advancing the document one line. If you had finished typing one line, and wanted to continue on to the next, you pushed harder, both advancing a line and sliding the carriage all the way to the right, then resuming typing left to right again as the carriage traveled with each keystroke. Needless to say, word-wrap was the default setting for all word processing of the era. P:D............................................................Those are non-printing characters, relating to the concept of "new line". \n is linefeed. \r is carriage return. On different platforms they have different meanings, relative to a valid new line. In windows, a new line is \r\n. In linux, \n. In mac, \r.In practice, you put them in any string, and it will have effect on the print-out of the string.............................................................when I was an apprentice in the Royal Signals many (50) years ago, teletypes and typewriters had "Carriage" with the printing head on them. When you pressed RETURN the Carriage would fly to the left. Hence Carriage Return (CR). You could just return the Carriage, but on mechanical typewriters, you'd use the Lever (much like a tremolo lever on an electric guitar) which would also do the Line Feed. Your next question is why would you not want the line feed?heh heh well in those days to delete characters we'd do a CR then use a Tip-ex-like paper in between the hammerheads and paper and type the same keys to over-write with white ink. Some fancy typewriters had a key you could press. So there you go.

Quick Question for Visual Studio 2019 Version 16.8.3, How do you connect the work item to the commit in the new git changes tab? I am having a really hard time using this new git experience thing. I can see my work item in team explorer but no idea how to add this work item to the commit in this new interface. Usually, there will be a button to add related work items when committing the files in the previous version. Please someone help me out? it look like you can just use hashtag '#' in commit message,That is the recommended syntax.Example:Fix a bug #1234That would actually close the work itemSee more at "Drive Git development from a work item"You can link a work item to commits but also other objects:The link types you can add within the development section are Branch, Build, Changeset, Commit, Found in build, Integrated in build, Pull Request, and Versioned Item.............................................................You could also turn of the preview of the new Git features.TOOLS=> OPTIONS => search for preview => checkboxsettingsIf you like the preview feel free to keep using it of course.Personally I'm not really digging it.MSblogPostAndReasons............................................................Looks like the option to turn off the awful "new git experience" is gone from VS2022. And there is still no option to add a DevOps work item like you could in the Team Explorer.Another example of M$oft not listening to their users.

The code compiles okay but it doesn't upload.The code is :int fsrPin = 0; // the FSR and 10K pulldown are connected to a0int fsrReading; // the analog reading from the FSR resistor divider void setup(void) {Serial.begin(115200); } void loop(void) {fsrReading = analogRead(fsrPin); Serial.print("Analog reading = ");Serial.print(fsrReading); // print the raw analog reading if (fsrReading < 10) {Serial.println(" - No pressure");} else if (fsrReading < 200) {Serial.println(" - Light touch");} else if (fsrReading < 500) {Serial.println(" - Light squeeze");} else if (fsrReading < 800) {Serial.println(" - Medium squeeze");} else {Serial.println(" - Big squeeze");}delay(1000);}And the error is like this:avrdude: stk500_getsync() attempt 2 of 10: not in sync: resp=0x41avrdude: stk500_recv(): programmer is not respondingavrdude: stk500_getsync() attempt 3 of 10: not in sync: resp=0x41I have checked all the ports and code and everything seems fine yet the avr dude error keeps popping up Looks like there some loose connection with the USB cable and Arduino. Few steps you can follow to counter:Try reconnecting the USB cable.Restart Arduino IDE.Restart PC.Your problem should be solved.

In RStudio, function variables, parameters or arguments are displayed by pressing tab.While VSCode has a lot of features, I cannot find a similar one for Python.I found a way for VSCode to show me the definition of the function while hovering in the function itself, but there are no autocompletion for the actual variables of that function (nor suggestions while writing). Besides, the tooltips close itself as soon as I start typing the variables.Is there a way to get something more similar regarding autocompletion and suggestion of function variables in VSCode while using Python?Thanks. According to your description, it is recommended that you use the extension "Pylance", which provides outstanding language service functions.Its 'Docstrings' and 'auto-completion' functions show us the function parameters and will not close the prompt when inputting:Part of its function introduction:

I know how to jump to the next and previous error (F2, see SO Link, jetbrains.com), but is there a way to easily jump between suggestions?If possible, I would really love to have a keyboard shortcut for this, as I am currently learning Kotlin and IntelliJ often has nice suggestions on how to improve the code.If there is no keyboard shortcut to jump between suggestions, is there at least any other way?With suggestion I mean things like the following (Ignore the "nonsense code")): F2 also works to navigate between warnings. If there are errors in the file, it will jump to the next error. If not, it will jump to the next warning.............................................................Adding to yole's answer: if you want to jump backwards you can use Shift + F2 instead.Additionally you can alter the severity of each inspection (or inspection group) using the settings menu File | Settings | Editor | Inspections or directly using the intention action context menu (ALT + ENTER or similar) when dealing with a highlighted element (be it warning, error, information, etc.).Note that some inspections are not enabled by default and many allow customization to your needs (e.g. class naming conventions, etc.).I did once increase the severity of all the inspections and switch them back one by one as needed or even turned many off (or switched them to "weak warnings"), just to easily jump back and forth between them. I can't recommend that approach anymore ;-) (too many highlightings then... but it may help to find out about inspections you consider more helpful).

I ask this question only out of curiosity and any answers I receive are greatly appreciated.As you know, Xcode 12 Beta is out, and it is really amazing and I would really love to be able to use it for developing flutter apps using the Dart SDK. I understand that there might not be any direct way to integrate this into the Xcode IDE but I wouldn't mind trying out any kinds of solutions, no matter how hard it may be. Once again, please ignore this if this is a silly question and if it is not possible at all, though I really appreciate any help I receive and I would like to thank you a lot in advance. Using XCode with Flutter is a terrible idea, even if you want to use it just as a text editor, there is no Flutter and Dart extensions like on VSC or AS............................................................To develop Flutter apps for iOS, you need a Mac with Xcode installed.
